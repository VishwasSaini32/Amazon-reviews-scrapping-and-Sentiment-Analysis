"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Inferior quality and built","I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage. 64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording. Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds. Face unlock very slow. Heat issue which charging and heavy usage Full charge takes more than 3 hrs Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Anshul","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue. However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new. So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough. Beware of Amazon,Samsung and seller.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Abhinav","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot. Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast. A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left. A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality.

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now What a waste of Money this has been","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sachin Sehgal","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Ok product for the price range","I found the phone to be mediocre in performance. Pros: 1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen. 2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage. 3. Camera: Good, but not excellent. Cons: 1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised. 2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better. 3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity. 4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks. Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better.

One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ) 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation. 3. SAR rating - lowest one 4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3. Not so great processor Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented.

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days) 3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM Cons: 1. Front Camera is not as good as expected 2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️) 3.

I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst...

During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much.

As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us.

"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue.

"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc 5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands. Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefully Super happy user since 3days. No complaints or regret on buying the phone.","14 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Rohith","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGGYWL6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value For Money !! Go for it","Review after 3 Day.. 1. Battery :- 5/5 Two day battery standby for normal easy 2.Display:- 4.99/5 Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers 4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. 5. OS&UI:- 5/5 Android 10 with One UI 6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast 7.Processor and performance 3.5/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated.. 8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone 9. Accessories : 2/5 No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches..

Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.

"नाम बड़े और दर्शन छोटे ...","Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were 1. When recording slow motion videos...there is always flicker on screen. 2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work 3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi 4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming 5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone 6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue.... Suggestions for people who have bought this phone..... Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early... Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone..... If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks.... I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..","19 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","unemployed","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The best phone money can buy at this price","I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI. -The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro. -The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short. - The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well. -The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. - The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output. - The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos. - The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading. Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀","04 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Pranjal Sharma","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna","I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21. The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display The issues I faced are 1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera 2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside 3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP). 4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.

"Yeah...it's best in this budget...","There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone. 1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever. 2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone. Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give. Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm. Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge. Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone. For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.","20 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Abhishek Sarkar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Don't believe in 5 🌟 reviews","This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 🌟 reviews . 1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery. 2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox 3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average 4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features) 5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time. 6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin. 7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze. 8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice Edit: changed my rating from 2 start to 1 star ( infact no star). This phone is totally unusable it heats up like anything, you can't keep the phone on your ears it gets so hot. Both Amazon and samsung are cheating their customers by giving substandard products and not accepting returns too. Edit: Samsung is giving level headset free for good reviews. So don't believe the positive review. I reassure this phone is an iron box.. gets so hot even when I'm not using, hot even when it's in pocket. One more bug is you cannot use dual 4g volte, second sim has to be in 2g to get stable 4G in first sim..","02 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Sandeep","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Here are the pros:- Good quality Excellent display Excellent battery Best camera Here are the cons:- Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at all Headphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby Atmos Charging speed is ok, not fast nor slow.

"Never buy electronics from Amazon..Feeling cheated by Samsung and Amazon","1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon. 2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor. 3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that. 4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.

"Really a monster of a phone at this cost","At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it...

"Samsung phones have signal strength issues","I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength. Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s. M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11 This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick. Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage. Pros: Super amoled screen 6000 MaH battery Cons: Signal strength is very poor. (You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app) Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc","22 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Pankaj","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.

Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags. 4.Heating issue detected in front camera areas It's not like overheat or something but it is hot. 5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively. 6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time. 7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason. 8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage. 9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now. 10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.","19 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","AnJan","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Keep your headphones handy , 2.Sensor's are not working properly ( this is the reason i choose this title , sensor quality is based on price ) 3.App search option is not available  , you must be very patient to search required app when you have an urgent need , you have to swipe all your mobile to choose required app . or change the launcher . default launcher is not capable of doing this basic function . Rest all other functions are good  .","13 Mar 2020","","","Yes","shankar k.","1.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4R63DF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best budget smartphone","I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone! In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone. The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).","24 Feb 2020","","","Yes","Ethan","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4R63DF/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for Money","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM) Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great. OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface. OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update. Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment. Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic. RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.

"Great phone in price segment! Worth it for ladies. Excellent exchange deal!","I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews! Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.","09 Jul 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","4.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4R63DF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Poor quality than other products of Xiaomi","This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.","15 Jul 2020","","","Yes","SYED AZEEM","2.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4R63DF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately. Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also. Overall I like this Phone. Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.

"Decent phone in this budget.","Just got it as an exchange against asus max m1, in around 4.1k. Display is really crisp, however lacks brightness. Speakers are top notch, very loud. Headphone sound quality is decent, volume level is good. Doesn't come with any screen guard or back case. For a 2 GB ram model, the optimisation is really good. It's quite fast if used casually, not for heavy gaming. Have not tested the cameras much, as this is lockdown time, but they are decent. One can also check google camera mod as this is a snapdragon chipset. Miui has a host of features, and it will serve you good. Switch to a good launcher like lawnchair or no a and you're good to go. Mi definitely knows what Consumer requires, it is the little things that matter. For eg, long press on back button to lock the screen etc. Cons: bloatware and ads, both of which can be controlled in certain limits. Even if you set default apps like chrome for browser, many of the links will still open in mi browser. This is pain in the neck. There is only face unlock , which doesn't work in the dark Apart from these, the phone rocks well.","03 Aug 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Akshay Ruparel","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4R63DF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue. However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new. So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot. Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast. A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left. A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality.

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now What a waste of Money this has been","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sachin Sehgal","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Budget phone for Avg Users","It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery. Pros : 1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ) 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation. 3. SAR rating - lowest one 4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3. Not so great processor Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented. Who looking for great battery & Samsung branding.","10 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Manoj Kumar","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Review after a week of usage","I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and cons Pros: 1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also. 2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days) 3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM Cons: 1. Front Camera is not as good as expected 2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️) 3.

"Good phone in this price","The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst... I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.

"BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.","I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this. Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara. During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGN617M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜).

I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now.

"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue.

"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.

"A good daily driver.","Pros: 1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come. 2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average. 3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage. 4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons) 5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience. 6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances) 7) The phone looks and feels premium while using. 8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes. 9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast) Cons: 1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised) 2) No headphone jack. 3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker. 4) No expandable memory slot. 5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable. 6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back. Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it. But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available. Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably) Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Aman More","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The original segment of One Plus","Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point.... Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage.... Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience... INITIAL IMPRESSIONS: No tint issue which has been widely reported. Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate. Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy. Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good...

"Bad bad camera","It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics.

"*Read before you buy!!*","Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression: • Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth. •Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness. •60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅 •Premium user-experience. •face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good. •Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame. •The signature slide button delivers the same good experience. Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️ *UPDATED* •Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour) •Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day. •No serious heating issues at all. •This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it. •One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Nikhil","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointing","Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me! But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Deblina Roy","2.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Near to mid range  Perfection","Got it delivered yesterday , used for about 5-6 hours , to tell you this is my first mid ranger previously I was using s9 plus , before that s7 edge and iphones in stone age . My first one plus , a mid ranger , I assure you it's no less a flagship experience , forget bout negative reviews, no device is perfect . This one has looks , power and performance , don't know how useful is 5G modem but who cares that's the baggage we consider it as of now Camera unit is also awesome perfoms well and remember it's a bloat free and advt free experience of OXYGEN OS .

"Great price!","An amazing phone! Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected. Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better. The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone. Camera could've been a little better. The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones. Fast as hell. Colors are very vibrant. Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack. The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.

But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.

"'More than midrange but less than premium '.  This phone has heating issues...😥","OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment. Pros. Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ... 1. screen looks great 2. Camera works descently but after some struggle 3. Warp charge 4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking 5.screen brightness Cons. 1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience. 2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate. 3. Mono speaker It's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass. 4.ufs 2.1 The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0 All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it.. I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool. If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again. This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance.. OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment. It's just a midranger phone in the end. For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlus Hope this helps ...thanks","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","ARYA","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Changed to Nord from 6t","I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6. But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation. I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.","04 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Unlike onplus box, all the edges were bent as if the box was fallen multiple times. As per product, phone look good, for sure this doesn't look like a premium phone, unlike other oneplus phones. Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience. Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account.

I am impressed with OxygenOS, Bloatware free and Camera (especially main camera video and slow motion videos are superb) Pro’s: • OxygenOS – gives very good user experience than other android mobiles. • 90Hz Fluid AMOLED display • Camera’s – image processing is very good in this mobile while using back main camera, nightscape, slow motion video and front camera • Stable video recording – with Optical and electronic image stabilization • Supports 5G network – I am not sure when it is going to be launched in India (may be in 2021.?) • Snapdragon 765G 5G chipset – supports 5G network with midrange performance (excellent for daily usage) Cons: • Camera’s for depth and macro photos – especially 2 mp macro lens giving poor quality output • Not suggestable for users who prefer heavy gaming like PUBG I don’t find more cons as of now Color tint issue?

"Worth every penny & please don't buy Oppo Reno 4","Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it. Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buying Oppo Reno 4 Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'. And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Sahil kalsi","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Perfect for my use case!","First let me clarify this: ""Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media"" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever! Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don't bother with it's presence/absence. Oxyzen OS as always is ❤️. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product. Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.

"Decent Mobile, but Genuinely Overhyped..","Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level. As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord. 1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate 2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength 3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's 4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessing Hope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users. If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!","06 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Jijo Paul","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement","My Nord Journey with Amazon:- 15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499. 18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers. 28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999. 05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start. Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon. ** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone. Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use. Pros : ✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10. ✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back. (U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality). ✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate. ✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography. ✓ Duel selfie camera. ✓ Light weight and easy to grip. ✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates. ✓ Battery backup is quite good. ✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment. ✓ Both Sim working fine. ✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z. No connectivity issue. ✓ No heating issue noticed during use. ✓ 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro. ✓ Fingerprint scanner is very fast. Cons : ✓ Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page. ✓ Need improvement in low light photography on front camera. ✓ All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case. ✓No Dolby Atmos. ✓No 3.5 mm jack. ## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...","05 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Atanu Mandal","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"No issues and great phone with medium camera","Camera: selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases. Performance: Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors. Speaker: Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise. Battery: i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster. Display: great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issue Verdict: If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone. Mainly VALUE FOR MONEY.","04 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Dharanidharan.S.P","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"OnePlus NORD detailed review.","So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ... I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit .. I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons . Pros- 1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent. 2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good. 3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone. 4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate. 5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie. 6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone . 7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price. Cons. 1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865. 2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion. 3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this. Personal Opinion. Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.

"Best budget smartphone","I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone! In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone. The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).","24 Feb 2020","","","Yes","Ethan","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X3P1N3H/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for Money","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM) Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great. OS: The preinstalled OS Android 9 with MIUI Global 11.0.2. user interface. OS Volume Bug: There is a bug which constantly causes volume to drop to zero. You can fix this bug by System Update. Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment. Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic. RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.

"Great phone in price segment! Worth it for ladies. Excellent exchange deal!","I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews! Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.","09 Jul 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","4.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X3P1N3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Poor quality than other products of Xiaomi","This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.","15 Jul 2020","","","Yes","SYED AZEEM","2.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X3P1N3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Display and handling is quite good. Normal apps work smoothly and I don't use phone for gaming. WhatsApp, Facebook, youtube, etc work well and 64GB Storage with 3GB RAM is more than enough for me.","18 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Maninder Parashar","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X3P1N3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Worth of money","This is one of the cheap smartphone according to its features. Battery capacity is amazing Camera is ok not so good. Two things I dislike about this Phone that it is made in China not only mobile, adapter is also made in China and the second thing is 10w charger is given in this box we have to purchase separately. Sound quality is clear and too lound I liked this also. Overall I like this Phone. Note: We have to use invoice as a warrenty card to claim our warrentybecause Warrenty Card is not separately given inside the box. So I request the seller to give invoice in good condition to customers because I have not received invoice in good condition.  (For those customers who have written ""Warrenty Card is not given"" in their review and for the seller). Hope this will help.

"Decent phone in this budget.","Just got it as an exchange against asus max m1, in around 4.1k. Display is really crisp, however lacks brightness. Speakers are top notch, very loud. Headphone sound quality is decent, volume level is good. Doesn't come with any screen guard or back case. For a 2 GB ram model, the optimisation is really good. It's quite fast if used casually, not for heavy gaming. Have not tested the cameras much, as this is lockdown time, but they are decent. One can also check google camera mod as this is a snapdragon chipset. Miui has a host of features, and it will serve you good. Switch to a good launcher like lawnchair or no a and you're good to go. Mi definitely knows what Consumer requires, it is the little things that matter. For eg, long press on back button to lock the screen etc. Cons: bloatware and ads, both of which can be controlled in certain limits. Even if you set default apps like chrome for browser, many of the links will still open in mi browser. This is pain in the neck. There is only face unlock , which doesn't work in the dark Apart from these, the phone rocks well.","03 Aug 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Akshay Ruparel","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X3P1N3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers 4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. 5. OS&UI:- 5/5 Android 10 with One UI 6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast 7.Processor and performance 3.5/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  ..

I'm totally disappointed with this phone.","23 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Monu kumar","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The best phone money can buy at this price","I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI. -The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro. -The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short. - The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well. -The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. - The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output. - The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos. - The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading. Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀","04 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Pranjal Sharma","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna","I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21. The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display The issues I faced are 1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera 2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside 3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP). 4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging. Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k","18 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Bahadur Sk","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"I would still buy it again.","I like the camera quality, screen sensitivity,  and browsing experience. The speed is excellent. I don't like it's sound. The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that. Lastly it will take 3 hours to charge and still the battery will only last for 24hours.","15 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Topisia","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Yeah...it's best in this budget...","There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone. 1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever. 2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone. Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give. Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm. Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge. Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone. For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.","20 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Abhishek Sarkar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Don't believe in 5 🌟 reviews","This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 🌟 reviews . 1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery. 2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox 3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average 4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features) 5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time. 6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin. 7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze. 8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice Edit: changed my rating from 2 start to 1 star ( infact no star). This phone is totally unusable it heats up like anything, you can't keep the phone on your ears it gets so hot. Both Amazon and samsung are cheating their customers by giving substandard products and not accepting returns too. Edit: Samsung is giving level headset free for good reviews. So don't believe the positive review. I reassure this phone is an iron box.. gets so hot even when I'm not using, hot even when it's in pocket. One more bug is you cannot use dual 4g volte, second sim has to be in 2g to get stable 4G in first sim..","02 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Sandeep","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Never buy electronics from Amazon..Feeling cheated by Samsung and Amazon","1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon. 2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor. 3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that. 4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them.

"Samsung phones have signal strength issues","I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength. Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s. M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11 This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick. Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage. Pros: Super amoled screen 6000 MaH battery Cons: Signal strength is very poor. (You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app) Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc","22 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Pankaj","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Second review","This is my second review.  This is after a week's use. So far I have found that phone is good. In my first review I had tod that battery is not that good. But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish). One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.","06 Jul 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","tom","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-667/product-reviews/B07HGH8D2R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A good daily driver.","Pros: 1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come. 2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average. 3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage. 4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons) 5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience. 6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances) 7) The phone looks and feels premium while using. 8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes. 9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast) Cons: 1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised) 2) No headphone jack. 3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker. 4) No expandable memory slot. 5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable. 6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back. Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it. But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available. Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably) Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Aman More","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The original segment of One Plus","Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point.... Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage.... Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience... INITIAL IMPRESSIONS: No tint issue which has been widely reported. Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate. Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy. Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good... Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead. Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Kiran KS","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Bad bad camera","It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.","02 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Abhishek Agarwal","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"*Read before you buy!!*","Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression: • Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth. •Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness. •60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅 •Premium user-experience. •face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good. •Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame. •The signature slide button delivers the same good experience. Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️ *UPDATED* •Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour) •Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day. •No serious heating issues at all. •This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it. •One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Nikhil","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointing","Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me! But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Deblina Roy","2.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better. The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone. Camera could've been a little better. The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones. Fast as hell. Colors are very vibrant. Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack. The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.

"'More than midrange but less than premium '.  This phone has heating issues...😥","OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment. Pros. Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ... 1. screen looks great 2. Camera works descently but after some struggle 3. Warp charge 4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking 5.screen brightness Cons. 1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience. 2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate. 3. Mono speaker It's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass. 4.ufs 2.1 The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0 All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it.. I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool. If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again. This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance.. OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment. It's just a midranger phone in the end. For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlus Hope this helps ...thanks","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","ARYA","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Worth every penny & please don't buy Oppo Reno 4","Hey Guys i won't go in Specs details as you are not reading this to read the specs. I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it. Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buying Oppo Reno 4 Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'. And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Sahil kalsi","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Perfect for my use case!","First let me clarify this: ""Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media"" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever! Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don't bother with it's presence/absence. Oxyzen OS as always is ❤️. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product. Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it.

"Decent Mobile, but Genuinely Overhyped..","Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level. As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord. 1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate 2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength 3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's 4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessing Hope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users. If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!","06 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Jijo Paul","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement","My Nord Journey with Amazon:- 15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499. 18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers. 28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999. 05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start. Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon. ** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone. Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use. Pros : ✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10. ✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back. (U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality). ✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate. ✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography. ✓ Duel selfie camera. ✓ Light weight and easy to grip. ✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates. ✓ Battery backup is quite good. ✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment. ✓ Both Sim working fine. ✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z. No connectivity issue. ✓ No heating issue noticed during use. ✓ 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro. ✓ Fingerprint scanner is very fast. Cons : ✓ Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page. ✓ Need improvement in low light photography on front camera. ✓ All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case. ✓No Dolby Atmos. ✓No 3.5 mm jack. ## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...","05 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Atanu Mandal","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Blue Marble, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Marble-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B086977J3K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"No issues and great phone with medium camera","Camera: selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases. Performance: Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors. Speaker: Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise. Battery: i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster. Display: great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issue Verdict: If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone.

"OnePlus NORD detailed review.","So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ... I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit .. I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons . Pros- 1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent. 2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good. 3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone. 4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate. 5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie. 6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone . 7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price. Cons. 1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865. 2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion. 3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this. Personal Opinion. Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.

"A good daily driver.","Pros: 1) Clean and bloatfree OxygenOS, which runs as smooth as they come. 2) AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate really go along to make the display above average. 3) Battery life is decent and will last a day on normal usage. 4) Sound quality is good and modestly loud. (Drawback in Cons) 5) The design actually fits the hand well as it is shorter than usual on breadth, and a bit more on length, all the more better viewing experience. 6) Gaming performance is average. (Similar phones in this range have better gaming performances) 7) The phone looks and feels premium while using. 8) The alert slider makes it very convenient to switch between different modes. 9) Face Unlock is as fast as other OnePlus phones. (Very very fast) Cons: 1) The camera is not as good as it was expected. The macro lens is pretty useless, and the main camera lacks depth and the colors aren't as vibrant as OnePlus 8. A bit too much of beautification was there in selfie shots. 4K video recording @ 60fps is absent but 1080@60fps performance is quite good. (The camera is better than most phones out there but it isn't what we were promised) 2) No headphone jack. 3) The mono speaker is on the bottom right of the phone, which tends to get covered by your hand while using. Also, being on just one side of the phone, the audio isn't as well delivered as it is on a stereo speaker. 4) No expandable memory slot. 5) The plastic frame (doesn't look like plastic but it is) is a worrying thing and makes the phone *comparatively* less durable. 6) Fingerprint scanner being under the screen isn't as quick as a traditional fingerprint scanner on the back. Recommendation: If you're looking for a phone which delivers high performance and smooth interface for your daily use, go for it. But if your prime purpose is gaming, there are better options available. Also, if you're expecting flagship camera performance, you might want to consider other phones. (Pixel 4a is about to release, that's far better probably) Update: Pixel 4a camera is surely much better that Nord's camera.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Aman More","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The original segment of One Plus","Battery usage update: Drains faster than other one plus models...so for the ones travelling frequently, this might not be an ideal phone...fast charging is a relief for ones who have access to charging point.... Morning to Night usage possible with moderate to slightly heavy usage.... Bottomline: A good entry phone for those who have never experienced One Plus and the ones with budget constraints... For others, one plus 8T(lighter than pro model at 180 gms) would be ideal which should bring 120Hz refresh rate and maybe wireless charging too..And for those who can afford and dont mind a heavy phone(200+ gms), One plus 8 pro or 8T Pro would be ideal ones.(As per Amazon reviews some users are reporting display issues with 8 pro, so 8T Pro hopefully will be a better model.) I still use 7T pro which provides the best of One Plus experience... INITIAL IMPRESSIONS: No tint issue which has been widely reported. Smooth given 12gb RAM and 90Hz refresh rate. Lighter than Pro Model but still feels sturdy. Camera quality on par with top model one plus devices in case of outdoor pictures, Indoor/low light pictures are not that good... Not a fan of punch hole cameras..would have preferred full screen with pop up instead. Battery usage - needs to be tested but seems to be ok....","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Kiran KS","4.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Bad bad camera","It's not very often I leave a critical review for any product. But i was so excited when my new OnePlus Nord got delivered to me earlier today, ahead of time. While i am still exploring the phone, the one aspect that is a complete let down is the camera. The pics I clicked were grainy and so not cool. I must say oneplus, you guys really turned me off this time, like honestly. Most phones these days look and feel alike with the camera being one aspect that sets the winners apart from ordinary phones...i dont know what you guys did here. Not expected team OnePlus...this is just not you. My Poco F1 that i purchased 2 years back returned 10 times better pics. Since i cant return this item, I'm going to live with this for a while before i upgrade. I am sorry for the negative review.","02 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Abhishek Agarwal","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"*Read before you buy!!*","Yea..pre-ordered on 28 July, got it on 4 August. Package was nice without any damage. So here is my first impression: • Display is so nice and 90 hz refresh rate feels so nice and smooth. •Camera is okay, but not upto the mark..macro lens and depth sensor at the back is just crap. Wide angle is okay, but images are too smooth without any crispness. •60 fps video recording at 4K is not there at rear cam, but is present for front cam. Don't know why they did that😅 •Premium user-experience. •face unlock and in-display fingerprint is good. •Phone lacks a true premium feel due to the plastic frame. •The signature slide button delivers the same good experience. Okay, so if you feel that you need a 5G chipset and be future-proof, definitely go for it. If you want a flagship perfomance, go for K20 pro or OnePlus 7T as this wont be a good choice for heavy users, but still a good experience in regards of games for a short-run(COD in high graphics and frame rate ran smooth without any sudden frame drops, because it got an overclocked GPU). StillI am satisfied with what I got here✌️ *UPDATED* •Excellent charging speed(Thanks to Warp charge, 10 to 100 in less than an hour) •Battery backup is so good for daily users. Lasts almost a day. •No serious heating issues at all. •This is a mid-range phone(one of the best) and should not expect a monster perfomance from it. •One of the best choice as a daily-driver( If heavy perfomance is not your priority)","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Nikhil","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointing","Heavily disappointed. So much of hype and the camera is not even upto the mark. Grainy pictures, looks like I have applied some kind of filter for my selfies. There is no way to undo it. The haptic feedback is good. However, there are several bugs on this phone. Hoping that they will get it fixed with an update! Also don’t panic and nitpick with screen quality! Looks great to me! But don’t  fall for the marketing gimmick. OnePlus promised something extraordinary and they have failed. Also, there were several troubles while registering my phone for the Red Cable Club. But several attempts and a complaint with the customer care, it was solved.","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Deblina Roy","2.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great price!","An amazing phone! Got it delivered today and also received red cable membership which was unexpected. Formally had a one plus too and in comparison this one could've been a lot more better. The silicone case that came with it however, has the most horrible smell. Wash it before using it on your phone. Camera could've been a little better. The touch is not as smooth as the other one plus phones. Fast as hell. Colors are very vibrant. Does not have a notification LED. or a earphone jack. The grey is very attractive. Blue will be better.

But this Nord is not supporting Augmented reality. I am damn fooled by One plus. Totally disappointed for my long wait. 500 rupees is wasted for prelaunch.

"'More than midrange but less than premium '.  This phone has heating issues...😥","OnePlus Nord is a very competitive smartphone in this segment. Pros. Device is pretty impressive and looks premium ... 1. screen looks great 2. Camera works descently but after some struggle 3. Warp charge 4.12 gb ram is great and is very helpful during multitasking 5.screen brightness Cons. 1.even when Snapdragon is said to be best chip in this range ,it's the one with same performance as Snapdragon 845 wrapped up with new ai engine ,it still struggles to maintain smooth experience. 2. Screen refresh rate of 90hz but due to less processing power it struggles to maintain the refresh rate. 3. Mono speaker It's not stereo speakers and you will miss this if you want more bass. 4.ufs 2.1 The storage speed and data transfer speed decrease is observed if you've used ufs 3.0 All over this budget pack gets everything right but the hands on experience says even after having better cooling system in it.. I have observed that my nord actually heats up very fast and it takes time to cool. If you're the one who is pretty intrested to use the phone continuously for several hours ,I would recommend you to reconsider this once again. This thing heats up pretty fast and it suffers to maintain the peak performance.. OnePlus tried to bring a top tier performance to its midranger device and their performance is good but not great , OnePlus Nord does not make upto it's marketing hype. There are several potholes in this smooth experience and I expect it to be corrected during software updates and future nord segment. It's just a midranger phone in the end. For the best you can have I would suggest that you should see 8pro from OnePlus Hope this helps ...thanks","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","ARYA","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Changed to Nord from 6t","I was skeptical about changing from One plus 6t to Nord as 845 still have more processing power than 765 and 5G won't be available in India for next 2 years, Nord has gorilla glass 5, whereas OP6t had Gorilla glass 6. But in the end, I am happy I switched, phone seems snappier, better display and new design. Camera is good and it was right time for oneplus to jump in upper mid range market, since their main lineup is getting expensive with each generation. I don't do gaming, so 800 series was not necessary for me, Nord seemed like perfect substitute, since I am on oneplus since oneplus 1 days.","04 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Box quality and finishing itself say this is a cheaper oneplus so don't expect premium experience. Another disappointment from oneplus, the redcableclub doesn't work for Nord, on the redcableclub Nord model is not listed, evening phone setup when to try to link the device it fails stating this device is already linked to another account.

I got it on 2nd August and after more than 24 hours of use i can say my decision and wait was all worth it. Phone is great. One plus is indeed flagship killer, its manufared by oppo india, and i have serious piece of advice for people who are considering buying Oppo Reno 4 Dont waste your money there instead get nord, i have seen for years how oppo charges atleast 10K premium for devices that have even year old processors. You can get SD765 instead of SD720 and even nord's top varient costs 5k less than 'Reno Shit'. And those considering Realme X3 pro zoom there's nothing special about it except for the fact that you wanna buy go with SD855 only you can seriously consider buying Nord coz apart for SD855 nord is better in every department and you don't realise any difference whether its day today tasks or heavy gaming.","03 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Sahil kalsi","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Perfect for my use case!","First let me clarify this: ""Nord does not have any disturbing tinge issues as hyped by the media"" A very slight purple color appears when you use it in dark with lowest brightness and that too looks good instead of disturbing. And I am pretty certain that I will not be using that setting ever! Overall the product is really good. The build of the phone is very premium. Main camera, selfie cameras are very good. Macro is a waste, though. You can take better macro shots from the main camera itself. I am not too fond of photography so I don't bother with it's presence/absence. Oxyzen OS as always is ❤️. 90hz display, battery, warp charge makes it a very good product. Will recommend to buy this phone. Missing headphone jack might bother you if you are not using blutooth earphones but I am okay with it. Overall impression: Good phone if you get it for 25k (8GB ram variant)","04 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Marble Blue","","Yes","Sarthak j.","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Decent Mobile, but Genuinely Overhyped..","Expected a lot, now struggling to justify myself..!! Obliviously pre-ordered  and got it on 4th Aug. Keeping all the hypes aside, its a decent phone with all the latest features and an average performance in most of the areas. Camera doesn't sound to be bad as like most of us heard on the initial reviews. Its in fact truly awesome, but few distortions in low light and indoor clicks. Also no tint issue so far for me which has been widely reported. We will definitely going to miss the Ear phone jack and memory card slot in this new Oneplus Nord. Obviously its a genuine 5G phone though India yet to upgraded to that level. As per me, below are key challenges which i am experiencing currently with this Nord. 1) Average touch response though it offers AMOLED screen and 90Hz refresh rate 2) Problems in reflecting actual network signal strength 3) Nord is not a good option for gamer's 4) Battery performance is absolutely average, but 30 W Warp Charge power adapter is a blessing Hope Oneplus will soon come up with some software upgrades and reduce the impact due to the above challenges for their users. If you are not looking for a high performing flagship mobile, Nord could be a King and satisfies you in all the aspects. Still its a Mid-rage King..!!","06 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Jijo Paul","3.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best Mid Ranger Phone... But need Improvement","My Nord Journey with Amazon:- 15 Jul - Pre Ordered Nord with ₹499. 18 Jul - Recd Pre ordered kit (1st Git Box) include with a T Shirt, AR Invite and Stickers. 28 Jul - Prebook Nord (Gray Onyx 12 +256) with ₹29999. 05 Aug - Received Nord before Open sell start. Now - Waiting for the Mail containing the 2nd Gift Voucher code from Amazon. ** Received new update Oxygen OS 10.5.3 immediately after switched on the Phone. Now i shared a quick Review of my Nord after 6 hrs of heavy use. Pros : ✓ Oxygen OS with latest Android 10. ✓ Built Quality is good with gorilla glass 5 protection on both front and back. (U r not Jerry that u rig everything so dont panic about built quality). ✓Brighter display with 90Hrs refresh rate. ✓ Quad Camera setup with a good day light Photography. ✓ Duel selfie camera. ✓ Light weight and easy to grip. ✓ 2 yrs of Regular software updates and 3 yrs of security updates. ✓ Battery backup is quite good. ✓5G Processor. 765G is the winner in his segment. ✓ Both Sim working fine. ✓ Sound quality is very nice working gine with Bullet Wireless Z. No connectivity issue. ✓ No heating issue noticed during use. ✓ 30 W Warp charger. Charging speed similar to OP 8 Pro. ✓ Fingerprint scanner is very fast. Cons : ✓ Minor Display issue. A negotiable bar is visible towards front camera on extreme low light conditions or zero brightness condition.(Not lucky 2nd time. After received a perfect OP 8 Pro with no display issue). Hope it will solve by software update as OnePlus already mentioned it in their community page. ✓ Need improvement in low light photography on front camera. ✓ All 4 side pannel were made by plastice meterial, so there will be a chance of some scratches in future if u use a case on it. Noticed some lines on the top side of the phone after applying creator case. ✓No Dolby Atmos. ✓No 3.5 mm jack. ## One updated feature in Oneplus Launcher setting i noticed in Nord, that is still missing on my OP 8 Pro...","05 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Atanu Mandal","5.0","OnePlus Nord 5G (Gray Onyx, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/OnePlus-Nord-Gray-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B08695ZSP6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"No issues and great phone with medium camera","Camera: selfi camera is great. back camera is medium quality not great like 8 pro. I tried gcam in this mobile, image quality increases. Performance: Blazing fast like SD 865. There is no difference noted in using daily usage. You only Notice difference in heavy gaming and heavy tasks from 765g and 865 processors. Speaker: Its is loud enough and does its job for its price for 28000 of phone. Dont expect like flagship speakers. if u put volume below 50%, volume of speaker is low and increase the volume above 50%, then speaker volume increases suddenly. At 100% volume, sound comes with some noise. Battery: i got SOT of 6 hrs with 90hz. battery losts easily for one day. When using camera battery drain faster. Display: great display like 7t. blacks are deep. No tint issues in display. colours are accurate. viewing angles are great. All google apps in dark mode are in grey colour(this is not a tint issue). So dont decide tint issue with google apps. Use dark wallpaper and then decide ur tint issue Verdict: If you are a Heavy Gamer(Only with ultra high gaming settings is not suitable but suites for lite gamers) and Camera centric user this mobile is not for u. Apart from camera and speaker, it is great phone.

"OnePlus NORD detailed review.","So I pre ordered this phone on 28th of July and I got this on 3rd August.... Thank you Amazon for faster delivery ... I'm posting this review after using this phone after a bit .. I'm sub dividing this review in pros and cons . Pros- 1. The design of the phone and overall build looks premium it is moulded in a way that it doesn't feel cheap aur even midrange by any means. If you want a quirky look then go for the blue marble .but trust me the gray version looks very elegent. 2. The fluidity and smoothness of the oxygen can't go wrong in anyway. That bundled with Snapdragon 765g is even more good. 3. The display on this device looks dope . Fluid amoled panel along with 90hz display just looks awesome. And trust you won't be able to tell the difference between 90hz refresh rate of this phone and the 120hz refresh rate of anyother ohone. 4.Battery backup of this phone is also awesome you'll get a whole lot of day backup even if you're using the phone intensively at 90hz refresh rate. 5. The cameras for this price range won't disappoint you , you'll get detailed photos with the primary lens ..you'll get super cool ultrawide shots with the other lens .. let's wait for the cons part for other two cameras. The dual front selfi cameras does their job very effectively be it selfie aur groufie. 6. As a cherry on the top OnePlus have promised 2 years of android update and 3 years Of security patch for this phone . 7. This phone is future proof as you're getting 5g ready phone for this price. Cons. 1. Don't buy this phone for only intensive gaming purpose as this have a 765g processor which will fall behind a bit behind 855 or 865. 2. The cameras are good but not the best , the macro lens and depth sensors on the back are just useless in my Frank opinion. 3. The frame of the phone is plastic , but trust me you won't notice this. Personal Opinion. Go for this phone you'll surely love it , according to me you should go for the 12gb ram and 256rom variant.

"No reason to buy Redmi Note 9 Pro Max","Please don't buy it. It's not a quality mobile, it just like Redmi Note 4.  No special features added in Redmi Note 9 Pro Max which can be differentiate with Note 4.  Battery is not so good, it doesn't retain power long time.  Other company's mobile are giving some special technology like Samsung M31 (6000 mah battery, Amoled Screen, sony camera lense and so many features) in lesser price.  It is not a value for money, not a good product.  Why the company has fixed so high price? The answer I would like to know from company.  After purchasing it feel nothing worthy with the set because I am still using Redmi note 4. Just looting with custom in the Covid 19 pandemic situation.  No discount isoffered in credit card nor no cost EMI nor Exchange in flash sale.  In the name of flash sale seller makes fool to us. This is my personal experience and opinion.  If any body hurts, I feel sorry, but I revealed the truth. You can get far better mobile with this price of ₹18, 500. Its a cheating with the customer because price is high but no quality improvement in comparison with Redmi Note 4.  I feel better Redmi note 4 with lesser price than 9 Pro Max.","31 Jul 2020","","","Yes","BHABATOSH DAS","1.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Aurora Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-602/product-reviews/B07HGLC2CG/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not worth for ₹18,500. Don't buy","Camera was not upto the 64MP mark, take a view of 64MP and normal camera pictures. Front camera wasn't good. Very troubled MIUI because you can't alter the toggle bar. It takes 1:31 minutes to full charge,take a view of screenshots while charging in a half an hour basis. While playing PUBG there was a high ping like 930 - 960 even though the signal was good. And also sometimes the network signal will lost completely while in a game. It think this phone has a network issue. If u were a PUBG lover, i suggest you to don't buy this. Battery life was not that good it stands upto 5 - 6 hours of non-stop gaming.

"Value For Money !! Go for it","Review after 3 Day.. 1. Battery :- 5/5 Two day battery standby for normal easy 2.Display:- 4.99/5 Super amaload with full hd.. Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers 4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. 5. OS&UI:- 5/5 Android 10 with One UI 6.Finger print reader and face lock 3/5 Face lock and finger print reader are not so fast 7.Processor and performance 3.5/5 Exynos 9611 is not meant for PUBG gamers  .. But for me its perfect as I am not a heavy gamer..  No lag ang hang till now..  but processor is outdated.. 8. Charging :2.5/5. No fast charging.. Provided with a 15W charger and iy takes about 3 Hrs to fully reacharge the phone 9. Accessories : 2/5 No earphone, No Back cover, No Screenguard..  So order backcover and tempered glass when you placing order as its backbody is plastic amd more prone to scratches.. Verdict: For this price  Its the best choice for a non gamer  ...","12 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Cv Vineeth","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Its just a market gimic to clail it monester like features i.e.battery 6000mAH ,15W fast charge ete but reality is far far away from claims.

With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied. I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing. But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah.

When recording slow motion videos...there is always flicker on screen. 2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work 3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi 4.

Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone 6.

Suggestions for people who have bought this phone..... Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early... Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone..... If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks....

"The best phone money can buy at this price","I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI. -The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro. -The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short. - The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well. -The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. - The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output. - The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos. - The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading. Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀","04 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Pranjal Sharma","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna","I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21. The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display The issues I faced are 1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera 2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside 3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP). 4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging.

"Yeah...it's best in this budget...","There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone. 1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever. 2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone. Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give. Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm. Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge. Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone. For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.","20 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Abhishek Sarkar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Don't believe in 5 🌟 reviews","This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 🌟 reviews . 1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery. 2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox 3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average 4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features) 5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time. 6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin. 7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze. 8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice Edit: changed my rating from 2 start to 1 star ( infact no star). This phone is totally unusable it heats up like anything, you can't keep the phone on your ears it gets so hot. Both Amazon and samsung are cheating their customers by giving substandard products and not accepting returns too. Edit: Samsung is giving level headset free for good reviews. So don't believe the positive review. I reassure this phone is an iron box.. gets so hot even when I'm not using, hot even when it's in pocket. One more bug is you cannot use dual 4g volte, second sim has to be in 2g to get stable 4G in first sim..","02 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Sandeep","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"WhattaPhone","Great phone. There is no overheating like others say. For the price you getting a quality phone with massive battery life. Here are the pros:- Good quality Excellent display Excellent battery Best camera Here are the cons:- Speaker quality is not good. It's loud but distorted at high volume with no bass at all Headphone quality is ok. Not the best. I prefer wireless because of Dolby Atmos Charging speed is ok, not fast nor slow. It took 2hrs to fully charge. It's fast for 6000mah Camera app need a redesign Aside all this.. it is the best phone under 15k.

"Never buy electronics from Amazon..Feeling cheated by Samsung and Amazon","1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon. 2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor. 3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that. 4. Spoke to customer care and they say that they can only replace if the product is damaged and no option for quality related issues. I said that I am ready to buy any other product too. But no response from them. It’s better to buy from local store than going behind Amazon.","26 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","A K.","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Samsung phones have signal strength issues","I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength. Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s. M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11 This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick. Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage. Pros: Super amoled screen 6000 MaH battery Cons: Signal strength is very poor. (You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app) Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc","22 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Pankaj","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-668/product-reviews/B07HGH88GL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue.

"Bad Product by Samsung","Not a Samsung performance. It seems it was launched without proper test n trials. I already had M30 so decided to buy M31 (6GB).

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Faulty selfie camera, video playback lagging no money back","I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product.

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot. Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast. A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left. A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality. I have to put the call on 100% volume to be able to hear at least a bit.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","JoeKidd","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now What a waste of Money this has been","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sachin Sehgal","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Budget phone for Avg Users","It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery. Pros : 1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ) 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation. 3. SAR rating - lowest one 4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3.

"Review after a week of usage","I ordered in first sale after comparing all the phones at this range and i am satisfied with this phone but want to discuss some pros and cons Pros: 1. Back Camera is good ( i compared it with oneplus 7 and samsung is good). No issues with picture quality with zoom also. 2. Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days) 3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM Cons: 1. Front Camera is not as good as expected 2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️) 3. Handset configured like conplex android even after having many in built apps but no app for lock apps and seems to be complex","10 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sahil Vasudev","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Good phone in this price","The camera pictures hv a yellow tinge which makes orange look like yellow and red look like orange. I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos. I am hoping battery performance wl improve in few days Camera pictures are good Lots of bloatware come with Samsung so had to uninstall/ disable them manually","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Urmil","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Worst Mobile... Don't waste money","First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst... I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms. Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...","13 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Niranjan Krishna Mucherla","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.","I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this. Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara. During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone. Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme..

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜).

"LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 ""MEGA MONSTER""","Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.","15 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Md.

"Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.","A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Sushrut Kamat","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJKDQL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue.

"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc 5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.

"It's a great phone!","Awsome product. I had my doubts buying another Redmi device after my mom bought one for herself 1 year ago. It got the annoying ads problem. But so far I'm yet to see my first ad. You have to be careful the first time you switch on the phone out of the box and untick all the personalization stuffs. Same goes for the first time opening any apps after booting. If then, u'll probably never see any ads like me. The battery is what they promised and it holds up to more than 1and half days for moderate usage. And the fast charger is pretty cool. 1 hour from 0 to 100%. It has Navic which is really accurate(tested it with GPS). It's really big but its right for me since my hands are big too. But probably for lots of people they'll have to always use both their hands for operating the phone, my mom finds it pretty hard to use. So, my honest review is, in 2020 this is an awesome choice and great value for money if you have big hands.","17 May 2020","","","Yes","Aravi","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-600/product-reviews/B07HGBMHTR/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"It has audio issues","Please do not buy this mobile, it have very low audio volume, and i also faced many difficulties in returning this smartphone amazon always offers only replacrments but o do not thinl that the proble is just with my unit so there is no point of replacement. I know that the battery life and came quality of this smartphone is high but after paying such a hefty amount, you cannot accept audio issue for alternative you can buy Motorola One Fusion +, i also bought it recently it is cheaper than Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, has the same specifiction but obe downside that it has a pop up selfie camera, if you think you do not need a pop selfie camera then you can also buy Realme 9 Pro from flipkart, the 6gb 128 gb varient is still cheaper than redmi note 9 pro max, i am very disappointed, the camera is excellent, the battery life too is excellent bit when it come to audio this phone lacks behind, of you are comfortable with somewhat low audio this phone is much recommended but if you are not then please do not buy this, choice is yours. Also keeping thisobile and my 2 year old Lenovo K8 Note side by side, i found that my 2 year old smartphone has even higher volume, there are audio issues in voice call also but i can excuse since there can be proble with my SIM also.

"Review of 9Pro max after a month","Camera : Best Camera so far in this range, it's giving one of the best picture and is all rounder and it's claims are 100% meets the expectations. Battery : Battery strength is not as expected. I hv using another phone Redmi 8 which too have a 5000 mah battery and trust it's giving better output in battery back as compare to 9pro max. Handling : A major flaw I started observed observing that the Phone sometimes FREEZE while doing Multitasking. A major flaw also observes and lots of other users posted in mi community too that phone doesn't connect to WIFI post software update. I too faced a similar issue.

"Great phone but had received with buggy UI,Quick toggles had missing buttons at first boot","The phone is great but on first boot,some of the buttons in Quick Toggles Menu were missing.I had to do full rom install and again reset the device to get all the toggles back.This kind of issue had arrived on EU based rom earlier and now this came on my device.But anyway,somehow i resolved it. UI-Does have lot of bloatware which needs to be removed after first boot. Camera-Clicks some good quality pics,but it should improve further and that we can only know after few software updates. Gaming-Works really well,no heating issues or game lags.Play at what settings the processor can handle and you wont face any issues. Battery-Battery is simply awesome and fast charger is icing on cake.Charges superfast and i get really amazing battery life on this.Its very important to use Battery saver mode,turn of gps when not in use,turn of auto brightness,it consumes lot of battery.Check which apps uses more battery and optimise it and keep it turned off until you are not opening the app.Check if any apps are consuming battery in background,so turn of background usage. Wifi/Call quality-As usual like other Redmi phones,if you are at very low signal strength area,you will definately struggle to get good internet speeds on mobile data.Some of the phones have really strong signal reception strength and gives better mobile data speed.But overall not a big issue,works fine. Overall experience-The overall experience with this device so far has been quite good.Didn't face any bug or something until now and does the job well.So,good experience so far.","26 Jul 2020","","","Yes","RAVI TIWARI","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-600/product-reviews/B07HGBMHTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"A gift to my father. After redmi note 4.","Great amazing display. Loud & clarity speaker. Charges fast with turbo charger. The charger even works with redmi k20. Good and fast side mounted finger print scanner. Mobile color interstellar black but it looks like blue shade. Good camer quality.  Out of the box it comes with Android 10 and miui 11. Only issue I noticed was when unlocking the device it was unlocking and freezing with the wallpaper and blank screen. After a while of 5 to 10 sec it was showing the apps until then no acces to anything even notification area. I need to check forward if the problem repeats.","13 Jul 2020","","","Yes","agaN","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-600/product-reviews/B07HGBMHTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Honest review after using it for 2 months !","Overall the phone is Great. Camera has amazing Dynamic Range but lacks Details. The video stability is amazing, it's like gimbal. Battery life is amazing. One day with heavy internet Usage. The phone is a bit greasy when it comes to OS. It get stuck. RAM Management is Hopeless.

"Go for it!","I've been a Samsung user all my life and have been reluctant in buying from any other company. However, this device has totally changed my opinion. Be it the camera quality, the battery life or the picture quality, this device stands out for its price. It's a total steal. I was looking for a phone that had a good camera quality and captured the light falling on the subject with all its entirety and also had enough storage so that I didn't have to worry about running out of space for atleast 2years. And this device meets all those conditions and even more, for a price that isn't too heavy for my pocket. Although the device isn't exactly black in colour as it shows on the pictures, (one could call it greyish blue instead) the colour is pretty pleasing as well. So no regrets. And kudos to MI for this path breaking innovation.","14 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Sandeep Mohanto","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-600/product-reviews/B07HGBMHTR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Selfie camera is perfect..!! 2) Charging speed is good.. approximately it takes 15mins to charge 20% 3) phone is too bulky.. Its hard to use in one hand 4) Phone's speed is not like expected.. i'm using 6gb/128gb varriant but still i feel its bit slow than my expectations after watching reviews in some youtube channels..

"⚠️ Don't buy! Good on paper but too bad in performance ⚠️","Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8. I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point. The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:- (1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates. (9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes. ⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.","09 Dec 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Aman Singh","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Neptune Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Neptune-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range...","To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick. Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it. Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch. Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users. Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like. The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a ""just good"" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra) Price?

"The UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF THE BUDGET SEGMENT","I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date. Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand. So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker. Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this. This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera. The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charm GCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥 The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗 Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better. Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all. Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins. Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better. Extra Features:- IR blaster ✔️ Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️ Self cleaning speaker✔️ Wireless FM✔️ P2i coating✔️ USB C✔️ Fast 18W charger in the box✔️ Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your device Very very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales. Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close.

"Budget King | But NOT for Gamers","If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as follows Pro's : 1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment. - It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor. - Front camera is also great. - Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps. 2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well. 3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day, 18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours. 4. Notification LED. 5. IR Blaster. 6. Dedicated SD card slot. 7. Headphone jack. 8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back. Con's: - When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops. Verdict: If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you. But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Bhushan","4.0","Redmi Note 8 (Neptune Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Neptune-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not a smooth ride","After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention: 1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it. 2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight. 3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick. 4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi. I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone. To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi. Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.","13 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Sanjeev Kumar Verma","3.0","Redmi Note 8 (Neptune Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Neptune-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good phone with few irritating discrepancies","side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed ------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------ Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Nitin Garg","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Neptune Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Neptune-Blue-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT6LD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"⚠️ Don't buy! Good on paper but too bad in performance ⚠️","Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8. I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point. The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:- (1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates. (9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes. ⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.","09 Dec 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Aman Singh","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Moonlight White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Moonlight-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT1FJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range...","To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick. Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it. Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch. Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users. Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like. The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a ""just good"" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra) Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!

Still fingerprint is fast enough. Also, the glass back is awesome. Overall a good phone. Got it for 8,999/- Also got Rs 100 Amazon cashback. It's a killer deal even in 9,999/-.

"The UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF THE BUDGET SEGMENT","I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date. Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand. So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker. Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this. This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera. The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charm GCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥 The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗 Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better. Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all. Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins. Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better. Extra Features:- IR blaster ✔️ Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️ Self cleaning speaker✔️ Wireless FM✔️ P2i coating✔️ USB C✔️ Fast 18W charger in the box✔️ Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your device Very very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales. Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close. If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️ Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit. Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥 Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.","06 Jan 2020","Colour: Moonlight White Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Kushal Dutta","5.0","Redmi Note 8 (Moonlight White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Moonlight-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT1FJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Budget King | But NOT for Gamers","If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as follows Pro's : 1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment. - It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor. - Front camera is also great. - Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps. 2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well. 3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day, 18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours. 4. Notification LED. 5. IR Blaster. 6. Dedicated SD card slot. 7. Headphone jack. 8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back. Con's: - When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops. Verdict: If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you. But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Bhushan","4.0","Redmi Note 8 (Moonlight White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Moonlight-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT1FJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not a smooth ride","After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention: 1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it. 2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight. 3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick. 4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi. I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone. To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi. Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.","13 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Sanjeev Kumar Verma","3.0","Redmi Note 8 (Moonlight White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Moonlight-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT1FJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good phone with few irritating discrepancies","side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed ------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------ Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Nitin Garg","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Moonlight White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Moonlight-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KT1FJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"नाम बड़े और दर्शन छोटे ...","Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were 1. When recording slow motion videos...there is always flicker on screen. 2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work 3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi 4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming 5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone 6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue.... Suggestions for people who have bought this phone..... Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early... Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone..... If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks.... I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..","19 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","unemployed","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The best phone money can buy at this price","I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI. -The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro. -The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short. - The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well. -The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. - The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output. - The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos. - The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading. Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀","04 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Pranjal Sharma","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna","I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21. The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display The issues I faced are 1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera 2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside 3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP). 4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging. Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k","18 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Bahadur Sk","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that.

"Yeah...it's best in this budget...","There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone. 1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever. 2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone. Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give. Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm. Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge. Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone. For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.","20 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Abhishek Sarkar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Don't believe in 5 🌟 reviews","This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 🌟 reviews . 1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery. 2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox 3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average 4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features) 5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time. 6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin. 7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze. 8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice Edit: changed my rating from 2 start to 1 star ( infact no star). This phone is totally unusable it heats up like anything, you can't keep the phone on your ears it gets so hot. Both Amazon and samsung are cheating their customers by giving substandard products and not accepting returns too. Edit: Samsung is giving level headset free for good reviews. So don't believe the positive review. I reassure this phone is an iron box.. gets so hot even when I'm not using, hot even when it's in pocket. One more bug is you cannot use dual 4g volte, second sim has to be in 2g to get stable 4G in first sim..","02 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Sandeep","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength. Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s. M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11 This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick. Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage. Pros: Super amoled screen 6000 MaH battery Cons: Signal strength is very poor. (You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app) Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc","22 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Pankaj","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best budget phone.... Strongly recommended","The best to choose among the available choices in this range.  I am using it since one week and I am fully impressed with all the features. The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.  Only difficulties I faced was to find app lock and split screen. But these purposes were fulfilled by external apps from the play store. I strongly recommend purchasing this phone.

"Value for money Smartphone...","I got this phone on 15th of May.I am writing this review  after 5 days of usage... 1.Battery backup is not very good. It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow. 2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range. 3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags. 4.Heating issue detected in front camera areas It's not like overheat or something but it is hot. 5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively. 6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time. 7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason. 8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage. 9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now. 10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.","19 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","AnJan","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish). One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there. I have to go all the way back to search again.","06 Jul 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","tom","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Raven Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-669/product-reviews/B07HGH8ML7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds. Face unlock very slow. Heat issue which charging and heavy usage Full charge takes more than 3 hrs Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Anshul","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue. However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new. So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Faulty selfie camera, video playback lagging no money back","I purchased this as soon as it was launched and its one of the worst decision that i made. Selfie camera is blurry and clicks yellow pictures, phone lags in playback video, all of a sudden, video will disappear and only sound continues to play, back camera isn't that great as hyped, its very low in quality, body of the phone is more like a plastic and very low quality material, overall very dis-satisfied with the product.

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot. Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast. A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left. A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality.

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now What a waste of Money this has been","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sachin Sehgal","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"not up to mark, waste of money","1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around. 2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point. 3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone. bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.","10 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","ravi patel","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised. 2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better. 3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity. 4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks.

Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3.

Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

"Worst Mobile... Don't waste money","First... I would like to express my experience of this mobile is tooooooo worst.... It's never performed like 6GB Ram Mobile.... It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst... I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms. Finally, my dear all who want to buy this product i strongly recommend that don't buy this mobile and don't waste your money...","13 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Niranjan Krishna Mucherla","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"BAD CAMARA, VERY SLOW CHARGING, NOT IMPRESSIVE  DESIGN. NOT RECOMMENDED.","I was using Redmi not 5 pro prior to this. I feel that phone was quite better than  this. Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara. During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone. Not at all recommend.  You may go go for Mi for realme.. I trusted Samsung  but eventually  it didn't  fulfilled  my expectations.","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Dhananjay","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much. My kid is fearing to take my phone because of this heating issue (Don't know whether it is pros or cons 😜).

"LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 ""MEGA MONSTER""","Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.","15 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Md.

"Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.","A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Sushrut Kamat","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products","14 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sp","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGJ7WLM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc 5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands. Since the frameless case in yet to be delivered, using it very carefully Super happy user since 3days.

Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost... Pros. 1) good features considering cost 6800. 2) Size matters 6.5 inch grt 3) Speakers are good Dolby 4) Comes with classic headphones with good looks and decent sound quality... No other phones now a days comes with headphones... 5) Quad camera gives good quality photos... 6) Selfie camera is also decent considering cost 6800 7) 5000mAh battery 8) can be use as power bank for other phones Cons: 1) Original cost 13990 is huge considering features...Other good brands like MI, VIVO, MOTO, etc sells 48MP camera phones for 12000 and so... 2) Accessories like back cover, tempered glass are yet not in market... May be u have to wait for them...Though 1 transparent back cover is included in Mobile Box...

Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently. Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day. Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all. I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product.

"Excellent phone for my parents","I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user. one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that. but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming","09 Jun 2020","Colour: Dazzling White Size name: 3GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Burhanuddin Kalawadwala","4.0","OPPO A5 2020 (Dazzling White, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Dazzling-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B07SDPJ4XJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Think and evaluate before you go for it","After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone. I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc. The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself. The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands. Here are the issues: 1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation). 2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization. 3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more. 4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it. 5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good. 6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device. I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long. I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.","06 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Praggya","3.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"One Plus 7T - One Word, STUNNING!!","I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days. Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging. Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it. The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.

One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.

"I think an all rounder!","I am among the first to buy this phone with prime membership. Posting this review after a week of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound.

"PLEASE SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T BUY THIS PHONE.","THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED. HERE ARE MY CONCERNS 1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY 2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T. 3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES. 4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE. I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE.

"Winner of 2019!!!!","This beast puts One Plus back in the game! 7T should have been the only product launched by OnePlus instead of 7 & 7pro! What a phone it is! Processing speed 5/5 Camera 4.2/5 Look n Feel 4.8/5 Performance 5/5 Lags 0/5 Charging 5/5 Highlights: 90GHz screen refresh rate is something that's puts OnePlus 7T in the league of the iPhones and the S10. Cons: Nightmode could have been better! Not upto the mark of Pixel and even iPhone 11 Battery could have been 4000mah, but still 30T warp is a mind-blowing deal. Memory slot could have been arranged. Wow factor: 30T 😘 Telephoto lens 😘 Configs 8GB-128 combo is sufficient Now, coming to comparison with iPhone XR and iPhone 11, personally I would prefer OnePlus because of flexibility, Android ecosystem provides to the users. Verdict: A perfect benchmark from most of the parameters. Performance wise is a SHOWSTOPPER!! Should you upgrade from 7 to 7T -NO, save your money.

"Disappointing and not expected this from a flagship OnePlus phone","Firstly, I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box. This is like misleading the customers by giving false information. Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS. Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2. Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage. I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera. I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.","03 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Alsaba Arshi","5.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not worth of spending so much money","I was using Samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try.  Received oneplus7t and set up the phone.  Not worth of spending. They don't have 3.5 mm audio jack and they don't provide type c connector also. Samsung phone comes with good quality headphones.  When apple released phone without audio Jack, they provided connector. It's big disappointment for me as I make lot of calls using earphones. One plus need to think about it..","05 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Srinivasa Reddy Madduri","1.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Indeed a TRUE FLAGSHIP!","I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end. I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus. The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it. Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus. I will now classify this review category wise:- DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes. IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curved back glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn't slip. It feels premium for sure. CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera. The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I've never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples. The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That's what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones. And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I'm not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions. BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won't be any heating issues. As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone. I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half's backup. Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it's an AMOLED screen. SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time. [UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half's usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far] SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother. SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It's an amazing experience overall. PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn't face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far. HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level. CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn't encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the ""Free 1-Year Extended Warranty"" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up. PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured. All in all I would say it's a True Flagship device in the 30's price bracket. I just don't know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating! But those 2 features aren't a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can't use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don't find any practicality in wireless charging. As for the IP rating I would say it's ""Unofficially"" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don't try them :P Well, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won't regret buying it.","03 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Mayank Bhargava","5.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"OnePlus 7T, the best Android device experience ever!!!!","I'm an iPhone user for last few years!! So I had a feeling any Android device cannot beat the camera, display and user interface experience of iphone. But here it is, OnePlus 7T with 90hz display is just a magic in hand. And also the camera is just superb. Initially I wanted to go for iPhone 11, buy instead decided to go for this and I feel I made a right decision.

"One of the Best Mobile Money can buy under 50k","Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it's money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro, Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money. Interface- I used MIUI, EMIUI, amigo os, but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It's super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram). Camera- One of the best under 50k that's the only thing I can say. Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphones Display- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes, really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone) Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.","02 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Sonali Rahinj","5.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The Fastest Just Got Faster","Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone.... Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list. Pros: Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box. As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built. Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience. In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use. The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices. I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation. Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless. The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device. Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series. Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes. Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great. The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team. The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet. The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots. Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device. Cons: Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement. There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen. The Camera software is not optimized yet. Battery life can be an issue for some users. The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.","02 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Vishwendra Singh","5.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A major major major go.","Hands down. It's a beast. Flagship killer anyday. Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price. Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger. Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premium Stock android experience which I always love. Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now, iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent. I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn't look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don't need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing. Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go. Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.

Major Issue...","this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen. there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS. but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.","04 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Parag Makwana","1.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Battery life sucks!","Battery life sucks! It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage. Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery. Think before you purchase. I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery.

"Worst Device that i have ever used in my life. Also the Worst after service brand.","This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare. Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.","04 Dec 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Ajmal Nizar","1.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Too many issues.","Ok so I am using this device from 3 days. Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons. 1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well. 2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review. 3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it. 4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus. Fingerprint, facescanner and performance is perfect.","09 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Shubh Mishra","3.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Initial impressions after 3 days use","Here are my initial impressions after using the phone for 3 days. Battery life is worse than my one plus 5, I usually watch YouTube for 1hr, 4g and WiFi are always on. And listen to music on Bluetooth for 2hrs. After end of day I usually have 20% juice remaining. Multiple apps have issues with the supplied OS. Youbroadband app refuses to open, Spotify has issues when listening to music on Bluetooth and camera app stutters at time. The new navigation system takes some getting used to, and the case, screen guard makes it very difficult to perform the back gesture. Now the positives. 90hz refresh rate is noticeable. Speakers are loud and clear. Screen is beautiful. I watched couple of hdr videos and 1000nits screen makes the video pop out even more. Phone is blazing fast. And I love the clutter free oxygen OS. I haven't tested camera properly, will update this review once I do.","02 Oct 2019","Colour: Glacier Blue Size name: 256GB","","Yes","Priyank","4.0","OnePlus 7T (Glacier Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 3800mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-748/product-reviews/B07DJLVJ5M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good phone at this price","I am writing this review after using the product for 3 weeks. Its my first time with Vivo and I must say it didn't disappointed me. I have been using Samsung/Motorola/ and Redmi over few years and all of the products had pros and cons. PROS: 1) Very Strong battery:  It has a 4500 mah battery but still its better than my Samsung M30 5000 mah battery. Its one of the best till now whatever I have used. After heavy usage still it can manage 1.5 days which is quite awesome. 2) full of features and options to customize 3) Liked the looks and comfortable to handle (as I felt my Redmi note was little heavy on the top so always it felt like toppling from my hand. Anyway design is person specific so I leave it to everybody 4) Face/finger both are working quite fast 5) 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at this price is icing on the cake 6) Mobile screen guard and back cover comes with the mobile are of good quality CONS: 1) Little heavy than my Motorola but still manageable 2) Not sure about the camera as I have taken only few pictures which are quite normal","22 Jun 2020","Colour: Mystic Black Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Vivo S1 Pro (Mystic Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-TST_Exclusive1043-3GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07S6BW832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Waste of Money....NEVER BUY THIS PHONE","I bought this product Trusting  the Big Name of VIVO but I was disappointed with the phone. Initially I got it replaced by another one, assuming that there was something worng with that piece of phone but the next one is the same ... The following features of the phone is not upto mark as expected:- 1. Camera is not like 48Mp or 32 Mp ... It's like 20Mp and 16Mp respectively.. Pictures get blurred on zooming.. 2. Battery dies out soon ..Again apprently it seems that instead of 4500 mah they've inserted some 3000 mah battery. 3. The phone is very slow in Fingerprint reading, Net browsing, Call conneting and you doesn't feel ever that you're using a 8GB RAM phone...Although I've kept a very few apps it runs slowly.. Even during data transfer from my chip it took long to transfer 20 GB data .. Aprox 2.5 hours.. Finally If you're paying this much money for this useless piece of Phone better you take two phones for yourself with same quality of features (in lesser configured phone) NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PHONE !!!!!!!","29 Jul 2020","Colour: Dreamy White Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Alisha Kumari","1.0","Vivo S1 Pro (Mystic Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-TST_Exclusive1043-3GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07S6BW832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Many of the time the speaker near the ear not working means while on call voice is not coming from another side. After disconnected the call when I try to call again same problem is arises. Some time this phone not read the external memory card. Many of the time in gallery photos will not open. And also camera app will not open. So in my opinion this phone have many problems. I hope company will resolve above problem on next update. Without resolving these problems this phone is not value for money.","07 Aug 2020","","","Yes","ABHISHEK KUMAR PATEL","1.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Glacier White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-613/product-reviews/B07HGH8JSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"⚠️ Don't buy! Good on paper but too bad in performance ⚠️","Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8. I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point. The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:- (1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates. (9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes. ⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.","09 Dec 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Aman Singh","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Cosmic Purple, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-8/product-reviews/B07X3P1N2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range...","To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick. Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it. Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch. Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users. Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like. The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a ""just good"" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra) Price? Bang of the buck for this segment!

"A Perfect All Rounder.","It took around 9 days to get the product delivered. It's a great phone. Battery backup is awesome. Fast charger is provided in the box. Front Camera isn't that great, but still, it's very good. Rear camera takes good pictures. Fingerprint is also very fast, but little bit slow as compared to my Realme 3 pro. Still fingerprint is fast enough. Also, the glass back is awesome. Overall a good phone. Got it for 8,999/- Also got Rs 100 Amazon cashback. It's a killer deal even in 9,999/-.

"The UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF THE BUDGET SEGMENT","I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date. Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand. So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker. Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this. This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera. The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charm GCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥 The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗 Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better. Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all. Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins. Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better. Extra Features:- IR blaster ✔️ Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️ Self cleaning speaker✔️ Wireless FM✔️ P2i coating✔️ USB C✔️ Fast 18W charger in the box✔️ Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your device Very very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales. Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close. If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️ Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit. Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥 Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.","06 Jan 2020","Colour: Moonlight White Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Kushal Dutta","5.0","Redmi Note 8 (Cosmic Purple, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-8/product-reviews/B07X3P1N2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Budget King | But NOT for Gamers","If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as follows Pro's : 1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment. - It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor. - Front camera is also great. - Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps. 2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well. 3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day, 18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours. 4. Notification LED. 5. IR Blaster. 6. Dedicated SD card slot. 7. Headphone jack. 8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back. Con's: - When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops. Verdict: If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you. But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Bhushan","4.0","Redmi Note 8 (Cosmic Purple, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-8/product-reviews/B07X3P1N2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not a smooth ride","After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention: 1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it. 2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight. 3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick. 4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi. I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone. To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi. Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.","13 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Sanjeev Kumar Verma","3.0","Redmi Note 8 (Cosmic Purple, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-8/product-reviews/B07X3P1N2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good phone with few irritating discrepancies","side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed ------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------ Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Nitin Garg","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Cosmic Purple, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-8/product-reviews/B07X3P1N2V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Faulty product.","I was very happy that I bought it in first sale but my happiness ruined because Amazon delivered me a faulty product. Whenever I try to turn on my mobile from sleep it always take 5 to 8 seconds to just turn on the screen, no matter whether I am trying with fingerprint sensor/Double tap method or pressing right side button. I tried to replace the product but Amazon checked my phone with some terrible blancco app and said that there is no fault in my mobile. They didn't replaced it. pathetic.

"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Inferior quality and built","I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage. 64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording. Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds. Face unlock very slow. Heat issue which charging and heavy usage Full charge takes more than 3 hrs Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Anshul","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue. However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new. So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot.

A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop.

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin. The more I use this idiot device, the more it frustrates me Anyone who recommends Samsung can kindly stay away from me now What a waste of Money this has been","11 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sachin Sehgal","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"not up to mark, waste of money","1) claims 21 hour of internet usage timing, i started using it after 100charged  but it barely last for 24 hour with 5 hour of heavy usage and even turned mobile in bettery saving mode.  so what is the point of carry that much heavy 191gm device all around. 2) phone heats a lot while its charging ,like you can't even touch it at some point. 3)internet bandwith speed in mobile as well as in wifi is not good. i had a samsung galaxy note3 where i get fast internet with same network. wanted to return this device but they had a very strict policy so you cannot return, you can only replace it.  even i am trying it for replacement it wont let me as i have to download balencco app and this app never say your phone is not working fine. i could have spend my money in buying other phone. bought on very first minute of release but al excitment turned down after seeing actual performance.","10 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","ravi patel","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Ok product for the price range","I found the phone to be mediocre in performance. Pros: 1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen. 2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage. 3. Camera: Good, but not excellent. Cons: 1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised. 2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better. 3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity. 4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks. Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better. Hardware wise some Chinese phones are better.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Tech Dude","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Budget phone for Avg Users","It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery. Pros : 1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ) 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation. 3. SAR rating - lowest one 4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3. Not so great processor Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented.

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days) 3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM Cons: 1. Front Camera is not as good as expected 2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️) 3.

Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much.

"LOVE TO SAMSUNG M31 ""MEGA MONSTER""","Samsung M31 is the best ever mobile I found till now with ""6000 mAh"" monster battery, superb ""64 MP Quad Camera"", sAMOLED Amazing display, 6GB RAM and 128GB ROM, very quick fingerprint reader and many more. I personally feel this mobile is made for me and people who need great battery, camera and lots of space for storing as many documents or videos as we required. As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us. Although most of the company send earphone with there mobile, Samsung hadn't delivered till now. It is sad because I have to use local earphone with an amazing Samsung M31 mobile.","15 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Md.

"Amazing. Bang for Buck. 5/5.","A great piece for a great price. This phone is for the people who want a phone from a premium  brand with sAmoled display , great set of cameras, decent processor AND THE BEST: VERY LOW SAR VALUE.. I don't use the phone for gaming , it's only for Day to day use and media consumption. It's great to watch full HD movies on a fhd+ super crisp super amoled display. A great 64MP camera that takes great shots.. The wide angle is just amazing compared to any competitors in the price segment.. The massive 6000mAh battery lasts more than any phone I have used before and the fast charger is decent enough to charge this massive battery within 2 hours from 0% ..So I guess this is the best budget phone.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Sushrut Kamat","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue. Samsung-it's a big flop to ur products","14 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Sp","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Ocean Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Ocean-128GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07HG8S7KP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc 5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.

"Best budget smartphone","I bought this for an older relative who needed a basic smartphone. Given its pricepoint I didn't have much expectations for the Redmi 8A but after unboxing and setting it up I have to admit - it looks and behaves like a premium phone! In almost every aspect 8A has been upgraded over the 7A. While it doesn't have a fingerprint sensor, the camera is much better than I expected. There is a bit of lag in opening and switching between multiple applications but it shouldn't be a big deal for people with basic usage patterns. To facilitate better grip, 8A has a non-glassy back that is textured. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the phone given its pricepoint. For its target demographic (light users who might just want to take some pics, use social media and the occasional app) this is a great phone. The only drawback I felt is that Xiaomi has been aggressive in bundling custom apps in the phone that deliver lots of ads and sponsored videos by default (and it requires some know-how to disable them).","24 Feb 2020","","","Yes","Ethan","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-%E0%A4%A1%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%AF%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B2/product-reviews/B07X1KSWZ3/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for Money","Redmi 8A Dual (Sea Blue, 3GB RAM) Battery: The smartphone comes with a 5000 mAH battery. For an average user, this is great.

Camera: Pretty decent camera. There are already too many reviews on this, so I'm not gonna comment. Bloatware: Probably, this is what bugs me most in android devices. There are bunch of preinstalled apps and games. Most of them are unnecessary for you. You can remove most of them but not all. This is pathetic. RAM Usage: After removing bloatwares, the system takes around 1.1 GB of RAM, so you will have 1.9 GB of RAM which is enough for the most users.

"Great phone in price segment! Worth it for ladies. Excellent exchange deal!","I was a little sceptical while purchasing this phone as it was my first Chinese phone as I was fed up with my mom's rough phone usage! She successfully killed many good brand phones like HTC, Samsung etc so wanted something really cheap this time. I paid 7500 for this phone even though the old price was 6500! Due to lockdown, I had no option to roam around! The best part was I got 3100Rs for old Samsung J4 in exchange with no mess, whereas local shopkeepers were talking about 1k resale value lol! That was less than year old phone though but still, I was happy with buyback price so went ahead and decided to buy this phone even though there are plenty of negative reviews! Now coming to the phone I didn't feel like I'm holding some entry-level Chinese phone! It's a great phone for ladies who use phone just for WhatsApp and calling. No problems found so far. The battery is excellent. Colour is catchy. The best part is Type C slot as all other phones in my home have Type C! Best phone for basic users. Not for Pro. I own LG G7, Oneplus etc so I know what premium means! So I won't call it premium but it's definitely worth a try! Consider the life of a couple of years and proceed as even branded entry-level phones die sooner or later. It's been only 2 days so can't say much about it. If there seems to be any problem I'll update my review.","09 Jul 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","4.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KSWZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Poor quality than other products of Xiaomi","This is the third Xiaomi product I'm purchasing but this time I'm highly disappointed. 8A phone is no different than Redmi 7A except that this is quite bulky to hold and has better battery life and comes with a C-type charger. Redmi 7A is a lot better than 8A in terms of design. Don't go for the Blue coloured one of 8A, cos it has a funny shade than what's seen in the pictures. Camera claims to have 13mp lens but has no quality of even an 8mp Samsung phone. Also has poor settings with so much beautifying filter which makes everything look so lighter in shade, polished and cartoon like. Xiaomi used to deliver top notch quality phones and camera at the same price range when they launched phones during 2015-16 time period. Xiaomi is compromising a lot on camera quality. The touch response of the handset i received is slow. Also they're refusing to return the product and instead they're giving me a replacement of the same phone which I don't want. When we contacted the Amazon customer care they're asking us to place the return after accepting the second replacement. Why this complication when you can return the first right away than make everyone take double risk of travel in this time of pandemic.","15 Jul 2020","","","Yes","SYED AZEEM","2.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KSWZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Decent phone in this budget.","Just got it as an exchange against asus max m1, in around 4.1k. Display is really crisp, however lacks brightness. Speakers are top notch, very loud. Headphone sound quality is decent, volume level is good. Doesn't come with any screen guard or back case. For a 2 GB ram model, the optimisation is really good. It's quite fast if used casually, not for heavy gaming. Have not tested the cameras much, as this is lockdown time, but they are decent. One can also check google camera mod as this is a snapdragon chipset. Miui has a host of features, and it will serve you good. Switch to a good launcher like lawnchair or no a and you're good to go. Mi definitely knows what Consumer requires, it is the little things that matter. For eg, long press on back button to lock the screen etc. Cons: bloatware and ads, both of which can be controlled in certain limits. Even if you set default apps like chrome for browser, many of the links will still open in mi browser. This is pain in the neck. There is only face unlock , which doesn't work in the dark Apart from these, the phone rocks well.","03 Aug 2020","Colour: Sea Blue Style name: 2GB RAM + 32GB Storage","","Yes","Akshay Ruparel","5.0","Redmi 8A Dual (Sky White, 2GB RAM, 32GB Storage) – Dual Cameras & 5,000 mAH Battery","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-8A-Dual-White-Storage/product-reviews/B07X1KSWZ3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"PLZZ read this before Wasting your money.","PLZZ read this complete information before buying from Amazon They do not refund if your product got defected. Amazon is worst in providing services so if you have any option to buy from Flipkart then go there. Don't waste your time on Amazon Regarding mobile Worst mobile i have ever seen Battery charging time is more than expected. Battery drainaing problem is there Camera will stuck when you click pictures. Poor camera quality they said 48 mp but it's like 12mp.  If you are game lover then PLZZ try another mobile. Performance is very low. I told Amazon customer care to take this product back but they are not helping me instead they want me to go service center in covid19 situation which is in red zone. They can't provide home visit because their technician life is more important than customer. If customer get infected it's ok for them. Thanks Amazon for this service now i hate Amazon more than tiktok. Unistalling the app right now.

"Good But Not As Expected","Hi all, As I have bought redmi note 9 pro on first sale, I would like to share my review on this. I would give  you my honest experience.. I will talk only about the Lacunas/cons  of this phone, 1.Battery-it lasts only for 24 hrs by general use,(like phone call, YouTube, whatsup video call) without gaming, while gaming it's battery drains fastly, for charging it takes 2 hrs. 2.Camera-As it is 48 MP, I personally did not find anything like 48 MP, rather samsung M30 has better quality of pics than this 48 MP, Night mode is not good enough,Its just a hipe,clarity has to be compromised, Even front camera is not good, pics get blurr by zoom. Same here samsung M30 again have gain.. So camera is not as good as they told., blur and shaggy images, I have really disappointed. 3.Display- kindly go for super Amoled display, if you compare FHD of redmi note 9 pro and sAmoled of samsung you will really feel the difference, 4.Gaming has heating problem,battery drains fastly, 5.weight is something I feel heavy, hard to use by single hand. 6.sound is average, So it's my honest feedback after using it for 4 days. I really feel disappointed.( In battery, camera, display, Sound) Now other things like processor, interface,speed, design, finger print sensor are best. Thanks 👍","22 Mar 2020","","","Yes","Janvhi J.","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Amazing Camera || Battery Drain Issue , Feels Bulky (Updated)","Bought Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black) in 1st sale, using it extensively. Read my review, if you are planning to buy one. EDIT: 1. Updating review for using more than a month, facing some strange battery drain issue, battery is not lasting even for a day. Once, fully charged, it automatically gets decreased by 5-10% without doing anything. 2. For daily usage screen size feels too big, not easily manageable, also device is bulky. -------------------------------- Pros: 1.  48MP Quad Camera (with Samsung GM2 Sensor) captures amazing pictures, both outdoor as well as indoor. - Even in low light conditions, photo looks cool. - Selfie looks more natural, not over beautification like oppo,vivo. 2.  6.67 inch FHD+ dot display looks good. 3.  Dedicated Memory card slot. 4.  5020 mAH li-polymer battery - it easily lasts for more than a day with average usage. - With 18w charger, it takes less than 2 hrs for full charge. 5.  P2i splash-proof nano-coating 6.  Notification LED 7.  IR Blaster *NavIC for navigation, but haven't noticed any difference than GPS. Cons: 1.  60 Hz display (vs 90 Hz display of Realme 6) : Difference is noticable, while playing games. 2.  For PUBG, RN9Pro frame rate setting limited to Ultra, on other hand, Realme6 supports up to Extreme. In short, Gaming is better on Realme 6 with MediaTek G90T. Final Verdict: If you want device with better battery performance, Redmi Note 9 Pro is gold choice. - For better display & gaming experience, get Realme 6. *Will edit review, after using few more days.","26 Mar 2020","","","Yes","Bhushan","3.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Read before buying","This phone promises lot but gives very less. Most Importantly 48mp option in camera modes. I didn't find much difference in normal mode and 48mp mode. Sometimes photos taken by 48mp are noisy, 48mp mode doesn't work well when strong ambient light present. Other issue is Google assistant. I tried many times to wake assistant with command Ok google, but it doesn't work only. I've set up everything in assistant which is essential to use voice assistance, but no use Please don't feel heart broken, so far these two are the only drawbacks I found but I must say battery is just wow. With one full charge phone last almost 2 days with normal use. I was surprised. Camera also works well for 13k mobile. Except 48mp mode, maybe due to some software issues.

"Honest review","I would suggest everyone to buy the product... I have purchased this in first sale at 12999₹ and is overall very satisfied till date at this price point. Pros: 1. Massive battery backup 2. Camera (Too good) 3. Design 4. Quich fingerprint scanner 5. Top notch quality 6. Very responsive and quick 7. Pubg and counter strike is very smooth 8. Fells as a premium phone Cons: 1. A little heavy due to huge battery 2. Slow charging 18 watts (2 hours approx) full charge 3. Display performs a little less in sunlight 4. Little slippery (if used without cover) Overall if compared to realme 5 pro and realme narzo with redmi note 9 pro it looks very premium and design is very good and wins in every aspect if charging is kept aside Realme only wins in charging capacity which provides 33 watts charger.

But in this Redmi Note 9 pro,  Xiaomi is making fool customers by by just changing the location of finger sensor at a wrong place (sideways). They say that camera is 48 Mp but when you take photos, there is nothing like 48 MP. Touch screen is too slow. Battery is 5020 mha but it is draining too fast. Nothing like 5020mha.

"Hype Hype Hype. Useless UI, Average Battery and Build quality.","The way youtube took us by storm by claiming it to have a solid and premium build quality. I was amazed. But soon after I ordered and received the product, I realized that the screen has a gradiant grey shading from the bottom. The glass quality doesn't look like the ones we have in premium phones. I wonder if Corning Gorilla Glass is also made as per grade and different rates. To sum it up you get a considerable product better go for Samsung M21 and thank me later.","08 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Afro","3.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Excellent phone for a moderate user","Writing this after a three day use To start with uniqueness, the quad camera setup, NavIC, side mounted fingerprint sensor, haptic feedback, glassy finish all the factors makes the phone pretty cool. Camera - The phone produces very good images using the 3 sensors(depth, macro, wide) according to customisation along with the primary 48mp shooter. The image produced will be highly dependent on factors like light exposure, camera handling, mode selected etc. Video recording is available with EIS & 30 and 60fps. There is an option to record videos with movie scope. Overall 4.2/5 NavIC - The ISRO developed positioning system adds more accuracy while navigating. I really liked it and its our country's technology. 5/5 Design - The phone is packed with almost all sensors, no issues. The glassy finish, front and back gives the phone a premium look. Comes with Gorila Glass 5 protection in 3 layers. 4.5/5 Dedicated external memory slot - no need to buy a 128gb variant fearing the limited storage, can expand storage upto 512gb. 5/5 Network reception - i witnessed a commendable hike in download speed, so the NW reception is very good. 5/5 MIUI - Yes there were some preinstalled stuff which can be uninstalled easily. About the annoying ads and notifications, they could be disabled with some settings(available on many internet blogs). There where some minute bugs, which i'd expect to be sorted out with the next UI update. 3.8/5 Notch - The user can manage how the punch hole cam could appear according to his desire. I dont like to hide it, as it looks good for me. 4/5 Processor - RAM - The qualcomm snapdragon 720g with 2.3ghz clock speed makes the phone more reliable and very smooth. The RAM was able to retain the cache of previously opened apps for a noticeable amount of time, so switching between the apps now and then is not an issue the Processor and RAM pulls it off easily. 4.3/5 Speaker - earpiece - Both sound outputs are commendable. 4.3/5 Type c USB & 3.5mm headphone jack - Type C cable along with 18w charger, charges the phone within 2 hours from 10% to 100% without any heating issues. 33W adapter can obviously charge the device even faster, but it's not provided in the box. 4/5 Battery - With a whopping 5020mah battery a moderate user can use the device for more than 1.5days with one time full charging. 5/5 Notification light - It was nice to see the notification light available. After stuffing so many sensors they did not forget to add that, appreciate that. 5/5 Gaming experience -  I'm not a mobile gamer, so refresh rate is not a concern to me. Still the qualcomm snapdragon 720g processor can easily handle games like PUBG or COD with HDR graphics. I havent faced any kind of heating issues nor lags while using the camera. Overall it's a very good phone, for this price range it is packed with commendable features and no compromise with the sensors.","05 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Tejas B R","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Go for other phones","The only thing I like about the phone is the side mounted fingerprint sensor. It's even faster than my Samsung tab s5e. Now comes the bad parts... 1. As has been pointed out by other customers, Internet download speed is very slow (never reaches 2Mbps). My 4 years old Lenovo downloads the same file at 4Mbps using the same service provider at the same time. 2. I'm not much into ""Mobile Photography"" but the picture quality is horrible. It becomes better with camera apps from Play Store(which doesn't give me control over the three other non primary lenses) 3. This is my first time using an MI phone and the ads are annoying af. Can't turn them off too. 4. The gesture controls are very uncomfortable. They can learn this from samsung. 5. I don't know if this has happened to anyone but I actually ordered the black variant but was sent the blue one. It's written as ""Interstellar Black"" on the box but inside was the blue one. Overall, I'm disappointed. I gave it to my sister and I'll be buying another phone.","24 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Prosper Singh","3.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Detailed personal review after 1 week of usage","Writing this review after 7 days of usage. Giving 4 star because of better battery life expectations, and also that MIUI needs to be cleaner (using for the first time. Was a stock android user since long). Other specs of the phone are fine. Delivery Experience - Great by Amazon. Couldn't recieve it quicker with all the lockdown that's in place nationwide. Recieved within 4 days or ordering. Battery life - Average. I am using the phone extensively, with regular music and light apps. Turns out that the battery lasts 1.5 days. I expected more. Camera - Good. You might find pictures getting hazy but I recieved a software update 2 days before (after 4 days of usage), and since then, the picture quality has been good. Picture quality has been good in all camera modes. Display - Good. Better than expected. Fingerprint Sensor - Takes a little time for unlocked screen to appear after you put your finger. Could have been better. No problems with the location of the fingerprint sensor. Heating Issues - No heating issues in phone whatsoever. Charger gets heated after 1 hour of charging or so. Performance - Good overall. No lags experienced. Charging speed - I could charge my phone from 0-100% in around 2 hours 25 minutes. MIUI - A lot of useless apps would be pre-installed. Half of them can't be uninstalled. MI Browser is bad. I would suggest to go to Apps->Default Apps and change few of those. Sliding up from home screen opens up the MI Browser. You can easily disable from settings. Note - Please disable the Dynamic Wallpaper Carousel. It eats up a lot of battery. By default, it's activated. Works well after the above cleanings.","14 May 2020","","","Yes","Neelabh Sinha","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Budget beast","Great device in budget, we should not expect much in 14k. Rest of the things are perfectly working except fingerprint reader which is misbehaving once in a while (Negligible). I hope MI will resolve this with updates. Camera: Works great except in low light(AI is smoothing the image quality while Processin) Battery: It's the USP of the device, working perfectly. Gaming: PubG in balanced Ultra works great if you have a good speed of internet on your device. UI : It's good but not the best, lots of third party apps needs to be uninstall, showing belly dancing videos in preferred results(I don't know why? SMH) Connectivity: Perfect, way better than my Honor 9 lite. Earlier I was getting 28 mbps and now it's 43 mbps on the same wifi. Calls are good too. Conclusion: If you are on budget of 15k max, just go for it. You won't get a better device in that budget.","11 May 2020","","","Yes","Haris","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A feature packed phone in the budget segment","Even though it's called interstellar Black it looks blue. The display is vivid, vibrant, colourful. Side mounted fingerprint reader is pretty fast. Camera quality is good and clicks photos quickly. The glass back is great to look, and hold, but it's a fingerprint magnet. IR blaster works great, the TV guide option in the Mi Remote app is helpful. The power button/fingerprint reader is a bit hard to press, but there's option to wake screen on lift or double tap to wake. The phone is thick, wide, heavy, and tall. If you're looking for a compact phone look elsewhere (compare dimensions with other phone), it's hard to use it single handedly.","26 May 2020","","","Yes","FJ","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"10 DAYS REVIEW- There are issues(screen bleed and burn) & bugs but I hope updates will fix them","### IN SHORT ### Overall great phone. I had a lot of problems to purchase this one, Amazon’s delivery OTP problem and many other problems due to lockdown. Screen issues got fixed automatically, but there are bugs in camera, music player, volume, UI which I hope will be fixed in future updates. ### IN DETAIL ### The phone got very hot on first charge, and after charging it started having screen bleeding(a very clear neon glow like bright line on the edges of the screen when seeing something dark grey) and image retention (screen burn, especially of time and battery bar and navigation buttons) issues. I fixed the image retention by changing the color scheme settings from Default to Cool and Auto. But a few hours later I updated to latest April2020 patch (there was no mention of screen issues in the update) and then both the screen issues were gone. I changed from Cool back to Default, still no problem. The second charge did not heat up the phone. So either the screen problems were caused by overheating from the first charge which went away when the phone cooled down, or the OTA update fixed it. Everything else is great. No major issues so far. Interstellar black looks gorgeous, but with the given black cover it looks almost fully black. I'm not a gamer, but I played PUBG lite and a few other games, and they were fine. ### NIGHT MODE PROBLEM ### Normally night mode images on phone's camera app is great, but sometimes it makes the dark areas grey, which looks bad. Gcam doesn't do that, so it's definitely a software bug and probably will be fixed. Gcam takes better but slower and more detailed night images, Phone's camera takes sharper and faster but less detailed night images. BUGS I FOUND: 1. Face unlock not working flawlessly because front cam not able to open sometimes 2. camera app couldn’t open a few times, fixed after restart or clearing cache 3. night camera can be way better with better processing cause gcam takes much better night photos, though gcam takes more time to shoot and process images 4. pictures with flash come highly overexposed and washed out, or the photo comes out as if no flash was used, and this only happens with the primary camera, not the wide lens. VERY STRANGE 5. sometimes downloading apps from play store gets stuck at ‘waiting’ 6. sometimes after unlocking, the phone shows only wallpaper and nav buttons, but the home screen appears when I press the home button, not a big deal but still a bug.","30 May 2020","","","Yes","Abhishek BIswas","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-549/product-reviews/B077PWBC78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Don't get 4gb. Camera is amazing though. Slow phone.","Ok so, this is a honest review. Plz don't go for the 4gb ram. This phone is probably built for 6gb ram. Coz it's slow. I got the 4gb, actually wrong product color as I ordered black, I got blue. The camera is actually amazing. But the phone is reeeeeeeallly sloooow. After unlocking the apps load so slow it's annoying and really sad that such a good specs phone sucks so much. So I'd say don't go for the 4gb one. And I haven't used the 6gb variant so I donno if it's slow too. But mine is really irritating. Not happy. But the camera is bomb and that I can't deny.

"Best Value for Money in this Range. Go for it without any doubt.","This is best thing you can get at this price from a reputed brand with Made in India tag. First time I ordered on the first day of online launch and am happy. I'm writing after few days of usage, but this should not be different as my experience with Samsung has been most consistent as compared to other mobile brands I've used earlier. Good: - Android 10! Beautiful looks! Finally I can delete SMS from notification now!! - Display is excellent with Blue light filter. - Performance is good. No heating or lagging. Real Racing worked fine. - 6000 Mah battery is BIG - 128 GB storage is pretty good. 512 GB card supported with dedicated external card slot. - Both dedicated sim slots support LTE - Fast charging and 15W charger top with phone. The phone came with 0% charge. Charged fast. - Mobile speakers sound is good, but I prefer external speakers for better bass in music. - Camera is really good. Macro performance is very good - look at skin in tatoo photo and dust perticles in deskphone photo!! (photos of M31 are from other phone). Both front and rear camera support FHD video 3840x2160. I may not require to carry my DSLR everyehere. - Face unlock / figure-print sensor response is good - Received next day by 11 AM ! Not So Good: - Not that thin, but ok. - Doesn't have Samsung Dex - Started to Boot Screen!! Gave me a little shock but selected reboot option and then every thing was smooth. An Android Updated (other than many application updates which is normal in any case) appeared on within days of launch. But update was smooth. No issue at all. - Feels delicate in hand but a Rs.49 cover was good enough. Wrongly ordered black while the set is blue. Just 49 so will reorder the blue one as well :) - Called Samsung Store, but no information with them about availability date. Still no call from them. Feedback - Feels good in hand and in use. It is a powerhouse and you feel it. - Will update after few days of use, but don't have any doubt as of now. Go for it without any doubt.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Ajay KS","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGLM366/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"False ads, poor camera quality, inefficient battery management","Lets just begin with the obvious. This phone's quality doesn't meet the claims made. Cons: 1. Camera Quality: Picture quality is just awful. Its worse than a 8MP camera. The pixelization is obvious and it is definitely not a 64MP camera. Do not believe the claims Samsung might make. The quad camera is of no use as the macro camera reminds me of the decade when VGA cameras were common. 2. Battery: Samsung may claim the battery will last for two days but it didnt last that long - no Netflix, Prime Video, heavy games being used. So that makes two of the biggest features useless. 3. Amazon's Policy: In case you don't like the phone, Amazon has made sure you are stuck with it. The switch from 10 day ""return"" policy to 10 day ""replacement"" policy is dowright wrong! Hold onto the shutters physical mobile stores - your days are not over yet. When you do request for replacement, there is an inspection of the phone at buyer's site - which I understand but the fact that replacement will occur almost on the 10th day from my purchase still keeps me at unease. Pros: 1. Display: The screen quality is good and has adjustment options for warm light and cold light. 2. Performance: Streaming videos and playing heavy games was smooth for the first 4 days but then again Samsung is known for fast deterioration of performance, so I will keep my eyes and ears open. 3. Sound: Speaker quality is okay but not upto the mark. In a noisy place you fail to hear the crispness and the boom.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Riddham Jain","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGLM366/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Inferior quality and built","I am using it from 3 days , 6000 mah battery is just for name only, it work for 1-1.25 days only with moderate usage. 64mp camera doesn't support zoom, camera doesn't support 60fps video recording. Build quality is not good, plastic back with lots of figure prints in few minutes handling, not look new in few seconds. Face unlock very slow. Heat issue which charging and heavy usage Full charge takes more than 3 hrs Would not recommend to buy , if you are looking  for good camera phone go with other brands like oppo or redmi , giving much better quality","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","Anshul","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGLM366/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Serious Issue","The phone was wrapped in dust. Although it was seal packed, still many dust were on screen and back side. It shows security concerns and Amazon, Samsung and seller must draw its attention. How dust can be reached in seal packed box? Now I'm lacking trust in Amazon,Samsung and seller. Either my phone was used or its components might have replaced, as in brand new phone,there exists no dusts because they are built in factory, but here shows how they are playing with the customer and their product. Phone is nice, large battery backup of more than 2 days, 6.4 display is big, camera is perfect and 6GB ram is enough for daily usage. All things are good. No heating issue. However my only concern is ""dust"" and how it came there if its brand new. So I could give 5 star,but now 1 is enough.

"A fab phone at this price!","1. First of all let me tell you  that previously I have used Moto G2, Moto G4 Play & Lenovo K8 Note. 2. I'm writing this review after 3 days of usage, using the 128GB version. 3. PROS. (a) A great delivery experience by Amazon, within 24hr delivery, the phone is sleek & stylish to look at. (b) Battery backup(6000MAh) is just awesome.  For an average user like me, it lasted for two days in a single full charge. (c) Very very smooth processor, as compared to other phones in this price range like Oppo and Mi. Works like a flash. (d) Brand value of Samsung at this price with the latest specs. (e) With quad camera & a 64MP main camera, pretty amazing photos are clicked. The low light camera is particularly helpful. (f) If you are a fan of AMOLED display, this is the phone for you. (g) No problem of overheating while usage or charging. 4. CONS. (a) With a 15W charger, it is charging slow taking almost 2.5hrs for a full charge, especially when compared to OPPO VOOC charger. (b) Not a very rugged phone, you might need to use a back cover from Day 1. 5. I'm satisfied with the phone & the experience it provides. Overall, I would totally recommend you to go for Samsung Galaxy M31, as at this price range, with the specs  & brand value of Samsung, this is the best buy. 👍","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Arsalan Khairul Bashar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGLM366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"My Real Review - M31 is Average","Hi I am using M31 Since 6/3/2020. Those who are interested to buy this set, please follow my real Review before buying M31. 1) Phone Display is excellent. It is a good Video viewing experience. 2) In Day light, Rear Camera photos are good but sometimes its colour is yellowish which is very bad effect in image. Even in Night light or low light Selfie is not clear, you have to use Night Mode but Outdoor Selfie is excellent. It has 8x Digital Zoom which is extra benefit. In this price Zoom Quality is not bad. 3) 4K Video shot in both Real and Front Cameras, the Video Qualities are amazing. 4) Fingerprint Scanner is good but Face unlock is Average. 5) Battery Optimization is not good. At present, it takes around 3 hours to complete charge from 6 to 100%, which was previously 2.5 hrs. I do not use any high graphic App. 6) It has no support of Secure Folder and Knox. I think that Samsung is required to update in section of Camera, Battery and to add Secure Folder App to compete other Chinese brand Like Xiaomi, Realme, Poco etc. Thanks.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Blue Style name: 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage","","Yes","R.

"Little overpriced. Not very ergonomic. Bad sound, defective piece.","Cons: Button position (power& volume) too high Fingerprint reader too high Heats up a lot. Though the battery capacity is high, battery drains fast. A lot of bloatware. Removed loads of stuff, tons still left. A full charge with original charger and original cable (which is quite short) from 0-100 took 2 hours & 28 minutes Speaker volume low. The receiver causes voice drop in phonecalls. Pros: Feels lightweight Nice display. The camera is decent. Update 1: Drained the battery to 0% and switched it off and charged to 100% and the battery seems to hold charge longer. Update 2: Outgoing voice gets cut for a few seconds at a time consistently. Going to request a replacement. Update 3: Returned my M31, found the voice unclear and faced voice drop. When I put my SIM card into my old Moto G5S+ the recipient immediately recognizes the much better voice quality.

"This is a duffer phone & not a smartphone","I have been using this for 15-20 days now and I am even more disappointed! I have been using POCO F1 since the last 1.5 years and I regret to have chosen to move back to Samsung! I so miss my POCO First the pros 1. The brand name - if you think it is one! 2. The display - It's super AMOLED and it's brilliant 3. The rear camera - clicks good enough photos 4. Build - seems decent Cons: 1. The UI - It's a big duffer. Samsung's smart switch was a pathetic attempt to move the contacts etc. Had I not cross checked, I would have been crying 2. The contact list - It seems like using an age old NoKia device today 3. Virtual Buttons - They aren't customizable 😭. What kinda innovation is this 4. Clear all apps - it kills the current app too😬. I killed my game many times while trying to fasten up this idiot device 5. Gaming - The phone slows down in 10-15 minutes. It's anyways a slow device 6. Front camera - it no better than an age old 2MP camera. The image processing is idiotic 7. Notifications - This idiot forgets to send email notifications. I have to manually keep checking my emails😭. Believe me, I have tried all settings 8. Notification Badges - Does not display any badges on the apps 😂🤣. You have to pull down the notification bar and keep checking 9. Dual Apps: This idiot does not support dual apps. Only messengers are supported. I have two accounts on amazon and amazon is not supported in dual apps. Similarly I have two accounts to manage on Linkedin.

Takes more than 2 hours to charge the phone. Pros: 1. Good cameras 2. Perfect screen size I bought it as a great deal from Samsung, but it is a BIG dissappointment.

"Ok product for the price range","I found the phone to be mediocre in performance. Pros: 1. Display: Trust me it’s amazing! You will love the vibrant colours. Images and videos look great in the Amoled screen. 2. Battery: 1.5 days backup even after heavy usage. 3. Camera: Good, but not excellent. Cons: 1. Build: All plastic build, this might have helped in managing the weight, but I guess the durability is compromised. 2. Night mode camera: Useless, all grainy and inconsistent photos. Other phones in this price range are way better. 3. Zoom camera: Photos are grainy and lacks clarity. 4. Face unlock: Mostly doesn’t work even after adding alternate looks. Verdict: You can buy this if you don’t like the Skins of Chinese brands, One UI 2.0 is heavy but better.

"Best Budget phone for Avg Users","It's one of the good looking phone with stunning display & mammoth battery. Pros : 1. One of the best display in the segment.( You'll feel it when you hold the phone for first time itself ) 2. Great battery life (6000 mAH ) with good optimisation. 3. SAR rating - lowest one 4.  Well weight balanced ( considering big mammoth battery ) Cons : 1. Samsung should have provided a case along with this ( hard to buy a case at initial days after launch _ phone is slippery and finger print & dust magnet ) 2. Camera is not so great as expected ( 64 MP)_ wide angle shots are lacking of details _ macro mode is also not great 3. Not so great processor Who can buy : people who don't do heavy gaming & not camera oriented.

Its a powerhouse with High Battery Life (For normal usage we can even use phone for 2 days) 3. No lag or hanging problem till now due to 6Gb RAM Cons: 1. Front Camera is not as good as expected 2. Finger Print sensor is back mounted while all other brands offering in screen fingerprint sensors at this range. ( disappointed at this and THIS IS MAIN REASON FOR 4 ⭐️) 3.

I returned the first phone thinking it might be a defective piece.but the second phone also had the same problem. I had almost returned the second phone also but then I figured out that the problem is not camera. Display setting had color correction mode on by default and it gave a yellow tinge to anything you see on phone screen If you face the same problem pl go to your display setting or search color correction and put it off. The phone wl return to normal colors I am using it for last 3 days and quite satisfied with the phone. Battery lasted 2 days but no games,music,videos.

It's working like 512kb ram ram mobile. And another great backdrop is it's bluetooth... It's connectivity does not meets at atleast basic phone... And another thing is it's speaker...This one also very poor.... Batter charging and backup also we can't compare with another brands in the present market... Because its took worst... I already requested to Amazon for return this phone, but, they smoothly refuesed my request as there is no chance to return as per their terms.

Camara- though it mentions 64 MP camara but it failed to impress me. When we click using front camara it takes 2-3 seconds hold time before clicking  the picture. No flash for front camara. During operation  I didn't  find phone to be user friendly The most disappointing thing is time it takes for charging. They claim that it is super fast charging  but it is even slower than my note 5 pro. In 1 hr it charges something  around  25-30%...... Design- Not at all attractive.. Doesn't  feel like new phone.

"Great 📱🔥❤️","Update 1:- AI scene detection really enhances the colours and over all camera is quite commendable according to the price, if comparing to my OnePlus 7T. I also got a case from Amazon at just ₹59 which was unbelievable. Attaching Pictures for reference. Will update in near future if found anything worth updating. ------------------------------------------------------ Great Specs. Great Value. I got the 128 GB variant. Only single Con is that the Back Panel Scratches Very Easily. After unboxing the phone and using it for an hour or so I could see some minute scratches, so i would recommend to get a skin. Also if you're thinking there are no cases available in the market right now as this is a new product. It might take some time due to the outbreak of Coronavirus. Therefore I have applied a transparent skin. Also another thing the length of the charging cable is too short in my opinion.","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black Style name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage","","Yes","Manik Agrawal","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M31 (Space Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07HGLM366/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome camera and Value for money - Go for it","Ordered Samsung Galaxy M31 within 5 minutes after sale starts. Really impressed by the quality of the camera. All 4 back cameras are working great. Wide angle feature is great. Live focus, Macro and Slow-motion features are awesome. Front camera is very good. It captures the photo very well in all types of lightning and background. Battery backup is good. 100% to 20% in around 30 hours with average usage. Screen resolution and touch is very good. Go for it if you have your budget less than 16k and looking for awesome camera and screen resolution. After 2 months usage: Battery charging takes more than 3 hours from 30% to 100% even though it shows Fast charging.  Battery is draining quickly when using mobile hotspot. Phone is heating too much.

As I am a student, I have to watch lots of lecture in mobile for that everyone need good mobile battery which is not present in other mobile except Samsung M31 with an student friendly budget. It's unbelieveable that I have a mobile with wonderful features within Rs. 15,999 only, no other company given so many things. This making me forever customer of Samsung, I am really very thankful to Samsung team for designing such an amazing mobile for us.

"Worst amzon service and product by Samsung. Battery performance poor.dont take online","Hi guys. Don't buy this product at all. Its battery performance  is very bad and it's taking more than 4-5 hrs to charginga and its getting complete in less than 1day eventhough we don't use much videos or games. Heating issue also there. Moreover,  I asked for replacement within 10 days itself but Amazon is keeping one useless mediating activity called phone inspection.  They will send some person who is not having any basic knowledge on phone or software and he do some nonsense. Technician means they should be professional  and they should carry some tools to test the phone. But nothing he iwas having. He simply reset my phone and starting checking charging properly or not. Means we should everytime reset our phone and charge and again have to reinstall or what. Very bad service by Amazon and the products they are selling are defective  pieces. Better buy directly from Samsung showroom or don't go for it at all. This is second time I am facing this issue.

"For Battery & Performance - 5 STAR , for UI - 3 STAR","hi, I purchased this phone few days back. So far I am quite happy with the battery life. I had both JIO connections on VOLTE-ON and no WIFI, so on Mobile DATA this phone performs too good. Approx 20 hrs of usage on mobile data, 8 hrs ON in a corner where JIO signal is low. works like a charm. On WIFI, it says 100 even after 5 hrs with a usage of about 20+ min. this is also good. Definitely, Samsung bloatware apps, that you cant uninstall. However, I dont like the UI/Launcher. One of the worst looking icons. I hope samsung is reading this. 3 stars for this. Some MISSING features for this price and as everyone else is providing. 1. LED Flash for missed messages/cals, etc 2. LED flash for incoming calls 3. Reminders & Goals missing in Calendar 4. All the Apps are Samsung proprietary. Contacts, Calls, Messages, Calendar, etc 5. Camera - Good in bright light or outside. not so good inside room even with good lighting.

"Best spec mobile with lowest SAR value under 15k.","Out of all phones under 15k, it has the lowest SAR value (radiation levels). Now a days most of the marketing strategy is around adding RAM, Storage and Camera. How well the Hardware and it's performance is optimised and integrated with motherboard and OS clearly shows the difference in using these phones. Else all phones should work same provided it all has similar spec and hardware Finally decided to buy this model after multiple reviews and device comparison of phones under 15k of all top brands. Infact my first samsung phone. While configuration, received security patch and UI updates From user experience from Lenovo, Redmi, Azus, Samsung seems to be incomparable with those brands.

"After 5 Days Use Redmi Note 9 pro Max : Honest Review from Samsung A50 User.","After 5 days Review, I bought Redmi Note 9 pro max after coming from Samsung A50 mobile.. My honest Review.. For this price it's a good device with all rounder performance. Still it's display not good as Amoled Displays in Samsung Mobiles. Sound quality also not so good compared to Samsung A50 mobile.. For gaming it's good for Moderate Gamers and device pretty Cool with 5020 Mah Battery.. 33 watt charger really very fast charging. MiUi have many unwanted apps, but it's easy to disable/uninstall with pc. After Uninstalling System unwanted Softwares, UI is pretty cool fast and Smooth. Though it's a Chinese product, it's assesmbed in INDIA. U may think for POCO X2 but it lacks Micro SD Dedicated slot.. POCO drains charge very faster due to 120hz display.. Alternate option : U can Buy Samsung m31 ( But charging very slow), Realme X2, Realme 6 pro. Display : 4/5 Sound : 4/5 ( Speaker & Mic) Look : 5/5 Build Quality : 5/5 Hardware : 5/5 ( SD 720G - Best Gaming ) Battery : 5/5 ( 5020mah with 33watt charger) Camera : 4.5/5 (back) Selfie : 3/5 ( not so good ) Call quality : 4/5 OVERALL Performance : 4.5/5 I am sure I will recommend to all people it's a Beast mobile in this price Segment.

"Awesome Device! Value for Money","My Honest opinion after using Two weeks! The Battery🔋 performance is Top class - Fast ⚡ charging gives 2 days for normal usage Sound quality is Awesome 👏 Performance also is Good with Android 10 & MiUI 11👍 Camera Quality is Top class, only one time it gets hanged, having some bug, after restart device is okay.  Hope the next update its resolved! Thanks to Amazon for good online experience Redmi Note series - A Quality Made in India product! Initially two months before I purchased M21 (non Chinese brand) (Samsung) through eStore ( unable to purchase in Amazon due to lockdown) during May The device delivered on time, but it have issue (Sim not detected) I tried service for return for replacement but no luck, They instructed to go service center. Waited morethan 2 hours in queue, but the response from service centre not good, however they refused without checking device not use jio and I give airtel sim and convenced for replacement, They accepted the device, and they told to check again device fully for replacement. More than one month thay not approved the replacement not return the money After making so many calls, remainders it takes two months to get my money back,  So worst experience in my life I had M21 purchase. It's not about the product, few may come with issues, it's all about service! Finally I prefer to go amazon to buy my favorite Redmi note product even it is Chinese brand, having good quality i have used my Note3 device for more than 3 years Thanks to Amazon as always better online experience!","20 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Sankara","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Aurora Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-558/product-reviews/B077PWJRFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But Overall I would still say there is not a competition in the market as compare to Redmi note 9 pro max. That's why I purchase this and gifted it to my father as it was not for my small hands I love the colour as well as the camera performance.

"Serious Wifi Issue disappointed 😞","Wifi lacks too much in this phone it stops working suddenly although showing full connectivity. Phone hangs a lot although Good battery backup if using regular apps like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Twitter, YouTube, Gmail, Chrome, etc.. I don't play games on mobile so I don't know about that. Currently there are no warmth issue.. Camera performance is something to buy this phone in this price range.. Lots of features are available in this phone for customization and enhances look of phone and performance. Problem with Wifi and hanging is irritating😖 Note- if your palm are small you can find difficulty handling this phone from one hand because of its size and weight, though you can do it using both hands easily. 😊","06 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Aurora Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-558/product-reviews/B077PWJRFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"MUST BUY🔥🔥","Incredible mobile phone at this price range. Don't think about buying realme 6 pro unless camera is ur priority. Neither think of buying motorola one fusion +. The charging of this phone is blazing fast. The battery also stays for very long. In one pubg classic match it reduces 4% of battery. THE MIUI is very feature rich. No ui at this price range can beat this. In night mode it can take photo even in dim light. Pubg runs very smoothly without heating much. The phone gets heated when fast charging. U can even go for poco m2 pro if camera is not ur priority.I thought The haptic feedback of this phone is a gimmick but it is really amazing. The screen quality is nice. The blue colour looks cool. It also has game turbo mode.","15 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Aurora Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-558/product-reviews/B077PWJRFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Camera is mind-blowing with very good detailing. Gaming experience is quite good it's ok for entertainment,not for serious gaming.

"Excellent battery, excellent cameras, and a triple slot. Value for money.","Pros: Excellent battery- 5020 mAh. 33W fast charging. Excellent primary rear camera and a great macro lens at this price. The Samsung ISOCELL GW1 is pretty capable and is not really that worse than Sony IMX686 as some of you might think. Triple slot for expandability The newer Snapdragon 720G SoC- good in performance and supports certain features like NavIC. Cons: WiFi connectivity issues in certain units- we are forced to reconnect to the network after some time. Perhaps a bug that would get solved later on. Edit: Got solved after the latest update. The display is good but a standard refresh rate at 60Hz might seem unappealing to many now that phones come with higher refresh rates.

The fingerprint sensor is placed in a wrong place, causing lot of inconvenience. There is shredding of music streaming through bluetooth as well.

"Very Good Mobile","It's a very good phone. Amazing camera but needs some change in settings so that you can click good pictures. Battery life is so good. I charged it to 100% at 8:00AM and tested for battery life, I used it regularly for around 23 hours along with playing PUBG. All about this phone is good. Really it's performance beast. The only minus point of this phone is that it has 60Hz refreshing rate that doesn't matter too much but feels bad when you drop from 90Hz to 60Hz. Processor and OS is good in performance. Charging system is beast. In my views it's very good phone. I also want to suggest something if you're going to buy redmi note 9pro then don't go for it but buy redmi note 9 pro max.

So u have to restart every time if it happens. 2) Network reception is poor. 3) The side mounted fingerprint sensor is not so fast.

"Best phone under 20k but!!!","A liitle costlier I feel after POCO launches M2 pro almost with same Features. But leave that apart. This gadget is quite good. I am actually impressed with the camera quality and battery performance is way better than expected. It hardly takes 1 hour to fully charged from 15 % level. I don't do much of gaming but use it for ather work like music YouTube, market news and it gives me more than a day standby🤩🤩. What I don't like 🧐🧐is the audio output of this device decent but quite low 😞😞I compare the audio with my nokia 8.1 and find the audio is way better in nokia. Miui known for providing regular updates but it can't match the experience of stock Android. Lots of Preinstalled app and recommend apps(ad). It's an annoying thing 😒😒 Lots of unnecessary system app already acquiring almost 15 gb of internal storage. Last but not the least this phone feels quite heavy in hand and it actually is. If you play pubg in this you can actually fell pain in your wrist but you might get used to it later. Overall a decent phone covers my all requriment pretty well. From my side a thumbs up 👍👍 but it would be great if the provide update for removing unnecessary system app which are security threads.","02 Aug 2020","","","Yes","Shubhadip Bakshi","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Aurora Blue, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-558/product-reviews/B077PWJRFH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

(color :aura blue , 6/64) Pros : its 5000 mAh battery gives me two days of battery life on a single charge (for high end gamer it will last for 8 to 9 hrs) Fast charging : Turbo  charger 33W allows its 5000mAh battery to charge about 25 persent in just 15 minutes Build quality : glass back makes phone quite beautiful ,gorilla glass on front and back ensures phone's safety . P2i protection is also useful System UI : This is my first Xiomi phone , So i must tell you that MIUI is user friendly and easy to use Cons : If you want to buy this phone for camera , It will better to stay away from it . Its 64mp camera is just a mith. Selfie camera is always on beauty mode and we cant desable it !

"Best price great featured smartphone","I want to buy low priced featured smartphone and found this and I didn't regret my purchase. It has great features at given price (5150 RS) in fact best phone to offer such features at price in current time. Screen: not best if you use Samsung amoled display or premium brand products but definitely its great at price. Touch, screen quality is good and won't regret. Performance: It's do job fantastic if you use for basic phone features, surfing and multiple tab is also good. I didn't feel any lagging. Performance is as good as xiaomi likes products. Battery : battery is just okay doesn't have much to offer. Battery life is not so great and hardly last for day If 4g data and location is on as it has only 2400 mAH capacity. Best part is its removable battery so could be easy to change in future if required. Charging is liitle slow and take much time to charge - no fast charging. It has micro USB ports. Fingerprint is very good responsive and face unlock works great. Face unlock capabilities is appreciable. Box includes phone, removable battery, charger, already applied Screen cover and TPU back cover with warranty card. If you OK with battery and have budget friendly smartphone then suggest this is best phone to choose.","04 Jul 2020","Colour: Neon Water","","Yes","Amit Pawar","4.0","itel A46 (Neon Water, 2GB RAM, 16GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/itel-A46-Water-2GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07SS3X5FX/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Highly recommended if you want to be disappointed.","Nokia has tried it's best to screw it's reputation and not to rise again. They didn't used a tiny bit of their brain nor the knowledge. The development team was 'high"" and let the product in the market. At this price, they could have developed something jaw-dropping. Very cheap quality plastic instead of metal or good quality materials. The phone feels worst then 339Rs Chinese phone. 1. They didn't put an effort to put USB C charging port. 2. In the era of Nano SIM they have placed Mini SIM slot, even though they could have placed a SIM adopter. 3. When network is in the transaction from 4G to 5G, and Jio is offering 4G phone at 700Rs, Nokia just launched a 2G phone. 4. The speaker quality is so bad and outdated. Highly impressed by the effort of nokia to disappoint its fan club.

"Nokia 5310 is the best basic phone in the history of India. Go for it.","Nokia 5310 is the best basic phone in the history of India. I am a big fan of Nokia. I have thrown Jio phone in dustbin due to its poor built quality. Pros of Nokia 5310 are Best quality display, it doesn't put stress on eyes even used for a long period. Best quality keypad for typing words. Great quality dual loud speakers with amazing sound in clarity and loudness. Great battery backup due to 1200 mah long lasting battery. I am getting 10 days backup when used heavily like phone calls 4 hrs per day. If it is in idle state, I got a backup of 30 days. Camera is good with 0.3MP. It has wireless radio feature. Excellent featured software. All things are very very very good and excellent. It supports 32 GB external memory card. It has 8MB RAM and 16MB ROM. Charger capacity is 530 mah. It takes 2 hrs to charge from 0% to 100%. Cons of Nokia 5310. I want Camera to be 2MP like Nokia 3310. I want charger to be 1ah @ 5 V for quick charging. Nokia is the very much better than Samsung, Infocus, Celkon, Micromax, Intex in basic or featured phone category. My suggestion to all the mobile phone users is to use a mobile phone with 2G. It  will emit 72% less radiation than 4G. Don't go for Jio phone as it is 4G and can damage your neurons of your brain. Like the sparrows disappeared after 4G signals.  Health is the most important to every Human being. You can compromise on technology rather than your health.  If you require 4G or 5G speed, go for Fibernet. As it is a wired connection, no radiation is emitted.","04 Jul 2020","Colour: Black/Red","","Yes","Good Human Being","5.0","Nokia 5310 (Dual Sim, Black/Red)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-5310-Dual-Sim-Black/product-reviews/B08BG8L72Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Wireless headphones can be connected with auto connect features but cannot connect to laptop wirelessly for playing songs. Earphones with it comes which is pretty good but not upto samsungs. Music keys are just Fine. FM can be played through wireless headset, thats awesome, because it has wireless FM. Cons: The main problem is that you cannot search for songs in an Xpressmusic phone thats is ridiculous. Charging takes time. No separate tabs for playlists, Artists etc Pathetic.

"Back to Basics Good Old Days :)","Well first about Amazon delivery ...its Awsome mobile was packaged and delivered in best way possible Now coming to phone Its built quality matches with legendary brand Nokia, buttons are very responsive..and all body parts are tightly alligned... Plastic feels very solid in hands and looks you are holding a premium feature phone white color makes you feel distinguished. Display is very sharp and bright not like cheap samsung feature phone displays which can't display even colors properly Screen glass quality is very good and feels premium just like 3310 reboot ultimately you are paying premium for that.. Now coming to most important part its Audio Quality..well being a fan of old days Sony Ericsson and xperia phones im a bit curious about phone's sound quality..this phone i bought just for nostalgia purpose not very much concerned about its sound quality but...... To my surprise it Handle audiophile grade Wav and flac files as well and plays them all smoothly sound coming from its speakers is very Loud and Crystel clear you will get a room filling sound i think this is the single factor justify the whole cost of this mobile....it makes me remind of good old days when we put songs on memory cards and played all but don't worry still you can download high quality tracks from deezer tidal and transfer them to memory card easily....i used 64gb card and works fine.... Now this is not the end of features you will get few interesting games too like Snake , doodle jump....

Best phone if u want oppo brand name and u are boared to ur old oppo phone... So this review is considering 6800 cost...

Sounds quality : 5/5 (unexpected, dual side stereo and Dolby is awesome, loudness, clarity and effects are far better then any other phone i.e. mi 7 pro, Lenovo, Samsung or honor) Photography : it's similar to other available options in market, day light as usual is very clear and crisp, didn't get time for more night photography, but few repetitive uploaded pics are in night mode with very minimal light which are good. Battery backup : best in this category (10% ~ 3 hours of heavy uses) , for heavy uses 30hours for normal uses it ll go up to 2 days.

"1 month user review.","It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down. Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently. Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day. Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all.

"Excellent phone for my parents","I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user. one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that. but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming","09 Jun 2020","Colour: Dazzling White Size name: 3GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Burhanuddin Kalawadwala","4.0","OPPO A5 2020 (Dazzling White, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Dazzling-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B07SDPTP6Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Phone Under 8K","One of the best budget phones available under 8K. I was a bit sceptical about buying it as the company Tecno isn't known in India but to my surprise it is exceptionally well made. Pros Battery Life - 6000mah Easily lasts two days Screen - 7"" inch screen for viewing videos and movies (Helpful for my mother as she struggles with small fonts while reading or typing) Two SIM slot and dedicated Micro SD slot Camera - 13Mp Rear Triple camera and 8mp front camera with dual flash Android 10 (Go version) - Up to date android with Go version for a seamless use Cons Ram - It is only available in 2GB and 32GB internal storage variant which the company should reconsider. Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable. Would definitely recommend this phone if you're looking to buy something under 8k or a back-up phone to watch movies & web series.

Feel and Look is just awesome. 6. Notch Display. 7. Ram and internal Memory. 8. Processor is super fast. 9. All 4 Camera working perfectly, i love macro camera. 10. Beast for Gaming. 11. Build quality is awesome just side with plastic xiomi can give metal at sides. Cons: 1.While watching YouTube, video quality is poor, why!!! i don't understand as in other videos it is good. 2. While playing games or doing heavy task temperature warm at processor side (which is left side of camera). This 2 things xiomi can fix by software updates. One less star just for this 2 cons.","09 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Mohammed Abdul Rahman","4.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Awesome value for money.","one of the best mobile under this price. This phone is awesome. I have 5 start. to light weight, great feature, photo quality with ultra wide angel, micro & 64 megapixel is awesome. I so lucky I got this phone on First sale with 10% discount. After using more than 3 weeks, I didn't find any issue. Battery backup is awesome, I usually charge only one time in day. after heavy use of internet, gaming like PUBG, call of duty, videos and watching online movies, still Battery backup good. Liquid cooling technology is good, after playing PUBG continually more than 2 hours, mobile little bit heat. but just rest of 3 or  5 minute, mobile get cool.

"The Redmi Note 8 Pro is powered by the MediaTek G90T gaming processor.","Redmi Note 8 Pro Specifications: 6.53-inch full HD+ (1080p) display | MediaTek G90T octa-core processor | 6GB or 8GB RAM with 64GB or 128GB storage with expandable storage support up to 512GB |  64MP main camera + 8MP ultra-wide + 2MP macro + 2MP depth camera + 20MP camera | 4500 mAh battery with 18W fast charging | MIUI 10 with Android Pie (9) | Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Camera This is the part which Xiaomi is hyping up, given there’s a 64MP camera out here. The automatic resolution is 16MP. The camera produces bright photos with accurate color tones, even at night. The selfies are impressive on this phone, and it creates a nice depth in Portrait mode, though it is not all perfect with edges on the hair. Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Performance, battery Games like Asphalt 9, Badland, Nova Legacy all ran without any hitches. I switched Asphalt 9 to high graphics settings and the phone had no problems handling it. The graphics looked smooth without any lag. In regular usage, be it just browsing on social media or using the phone to edit photos to keeping 20 tabs open on Chrome, the experience was smooth. The only issue I noticed, the phone also got warm around the top when gaming for too long. On the battery front, the Redmi Note 8 Pro has a 4500 mAh battery. The 18W fast charger ensures a full charge in under two hours. With moderate usage, you can go up to two days on this phone, while heavy-duty usage means around one and a half days on the device. The Redmi Note 8 Pro runs MIUI 10 based on Android Pie. Xiaomi has said it will get MIUI 11 by the end of December. It does come with Alexa pre-loaded, though Google Assistant is there as well. Redmi Note 8 Pro Review: Design, Display The Redmi Note 8 Pro has a curved back design, though this is a broad and bulky device compared to the previous variant. One reason is the bigger battery. Redmi Note 8 Pro also has a bigger display at 6.53-inches, with the full HD+ resolution. The curved back means it is easier to hold this with one hand, but the size of the device might not always make it possible. The positioning of the fingerprint sensor right at the bottom of the camera module is not ideal either, because you will end up touching the lens like I did and covering it with smudges. The macro camera is placed away from the other three sensors to the right with flash on top of it. The idea here is to let people use flash to add more light when using macro shots. The display on the Redmi Note 8 Pro continues to be one of the best for its price. It does come with Widevine L1 certification you can stream content at HD or full HD on YouTube, Netflix, etc. The viewing angles are good, and this is a sharp display, which works well in most scenarios.","09 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Abhiishek Mohta","5.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Mid Range Beast | Flagship Gaming Experience","Read this review, if Planning to buy Redmi Note 8 Pro. Bought Redmi Note 8 Pro in first sale, using it extensively, pretty satisfied with overall experience so far. Battery: 5/5 Performance: 5/5 Display: 4/5 Camera: 5/5 #Pro's: 1. Superb Gaming performance 2. Multitasking is smooth. 3. Liquid cooling system which cools down your device & device doesn't get heated even while gaming. 4. Amazing camera. 5. Alexa support, which is first time available on any mobile. 6. Dedicated SD card slot. 7. P2i coating to save device from water splashes. 8. Gorilla glass 5 on front as well as on back. 9. 18 watt charger inside box. 10. IR Blaster. 11. Notification led. 12. Headphone jack is still there. 13. Fingerprint sensor is placed little too high but it faster than usual in display fingerprint sensors. #Con's: 1. No AMOLED display.  :( 2. No in-display fingerprint sensor. 3. Mediatek processor: If you are advance user & into rooting, customization, then only it will affect you. Otherwise, no need to worry. @PERFORMANCE: - Note 8 Pro comes with Helio G90T mediatek cheapset which having mediatek hyper engine that is well optimized for gaming, also it offers Game Turbo mode. So, gaming experience is best on this device. Tried PUBG, COD in high settings, it was lag free without any frame drops. - In Antutu Benchmark test, Helio G90T scores much better than Snapdragon 712. @BATTERY: - 4500 mAh of Battery gets fully charged in approx 2 hrs with 18 w charger (which comes inside box), with moderate usage, it easily lasts for more than a day. @CAMERA: - 64 MP Quad cam captures amazing portraits. It also offers Ultra wide, macro lens, night mode. Even in low light/night conditions, it clicks above average pics. - With 20 MP Front camera, Selfies looks beautiful, we can control background blurness manually. - In video recording, it can shoot 4k video recording. It also provides 960fps Slo-mo recording feature. VERDICT: Overall, Redmi Note 8 Pro is best device in 15k price segment offering many features which competitors don't offer. If your main priority is Gaming, Performance, Camera then definitely go for Redmi Note 8. Or If AMOLED Display, in display fingerprint sensor is your priority then go for Realme XT. Will update review after using few more weeks.","07 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Bhushan","4.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good Phone with nice camera and specs! But No support for Data Transfer","Glad to be the first one to write a review for this phone! The Picture clarity in the Rear Camera is very detailed with proper light effects in case of LOW / VERY Low Light, the 64MP Option should be used when you have no worry about storage space and you know that every single Photo that you will take using this option will be 10MB+ going up to 25MB depending on the details captured in the image. The Front Camera of 20MP is also very stable and takes good images. It is nice to say that Redmi does not apply any default BEAUTIFICATION effect to your photos just like REALME does! Actually, I had purchased this phone to replace my iPhone 6s, however, I was totally dissatisfied as there is No software for any data transfer between iPhone and Redmi for that matter Redmi phones do not have any INBUILT application for data transfer from Android to Android or iOS to Android which is why the rating is reduced by 2 Points. It seems to me that Redmi has manufactured and thought of mobile phones for FIRST TIME BUYERS only! So this issue is not addressed, and maybe it can be looked into if they want to! In comparison, if you check for M30s from Samsung (similar specs and price), you get a default option of moving your data including SMS, Contacts, Photos etc without any problems from iOS or Android! About the return option and contacting Amazon / Redmi, the Customer Care at Amazon are absolutely clueless and will not say a word about the purchase, will simply ask you to contact the customer care of Apple OR Redmi (whatever are the 2 phones that you have - Old and New), the Redmi Customer Care person will say you can download the apps called XANDER etc, which are of no use and third-party apps which won't help at all in any transfer of data. Please note that though AMAZON may mention RETURN POSSIBLE UP TO __ NOV 2019, actually you cannot return the phone unless the phone is received in a PHYSICALLY DAMAGED condition which would have to be proved to Amazon by sending the Photos to them and if they think it is genuine, else RETURN IS NOT POSSIBLE!!! All in all a good phone for first-time buyers (considering the camera specs and price point), but a clear NO for migration! Also if you don't want to keep the phone or you are thinking that you will buy, check, decide and return then please note that it doesn't work!","06 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Afzal","3.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Total Crap. ..","Well, I was waiting long for this mobile, but when I received it my dreams were shattered. On the very first sale in bought this mobile. When I removed the tampered  (plastic covering screen ) there were scratches on the screen. I wonder what happened to the control check of xiaomi? How can they so carelessly sell the mobile without proper inspection? This reflects how customer oriented they are! About the phone functioning I cannot comment any thing as I did not use it more than 20 minutes . But one thing is for sure, if things are sold without proper  inspection and quality check, what being a customer we receive is going to be a ""CRAP"".","08 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Dr. Sumit","1.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Killer phone at this price for performance and gaming","It is the best option to buy a gaming mobile at this price range. Visit my YouTube channel ""Indian Tech Helper"" for mobile related videos. Pros: Everything is good given on product page. Cons: Battery drains little bit faster. Camera has to be improved. Camera bump is more. A case with Camera protection is recommended. By the way these all are minor cons. Some may fixed by updates.

"The perfect value for money","Been using the phone for 2 weeks and it's safe to say that it's worth your money. Performance being the strong point is top notch..no complaints here. Even the display being IPS is great too.Design is sleek and premium unlike previous redmi phones. For the temps it definitely heats (which the the primary concern since the day it was announced)...but its not an issue,definitely not...at least not in my unit and it is cool and stable when not gaming. What my concern was it's battery ,maybe the g90t is power hungry and 4500mah lasts almost a day..I wished it to last for the next half too. I hope redmi fix in an ota update 🤞, the 18watt charger comes as a life saver here, it was a must and thanks redmi for providing it in the box. ....will update this review in the future after long term use.... Is this phone worth your money 💰-YES...","11 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Abhishek P.","5.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Heating up problem. Mediatech processor.","Phone get heated up in simple 30/40 minutes of simple game playing. It seems  Xiaomi has compromised in this segment  by lowering the price in comparision with realme XT. I highly recommend not to buy the phone if you can't tolerate the heating issue. Sometimes it's temperature go beyond 50 degree Celsius. This is the major draw back of redmi note 8 pro. Those who like to play game should remain away from this phone.

"Worth deal for 18k (8gb, 128gb)","Configuration of this phone is very good that's the only reason I purchased this one. If you wish to save your money go for it. Android OS phones work well for max 2-3 years after that it you will experience same lagging issues and buy new phone. Touch is very good. No issues. Camera is enough to show true colors. If you are expecting DSLR quality then buy Camera not phone. No heating issues as of now for normal usage (calls, songs, WhatsApp, FB, you tube, office mails, Skype). Not everyone is hardcore gamers. Check reviews from hardcore gamers for pubg etc...

"Redmi Note 8 Pro (Shadow Black, 6GB | 64GB) - A Camera Beast - Gaming Powerhouse","Redmi Note 8 Pro DESIGN  -  Solid and Well built, Front & back Gorilla Glass 5 protection with curved edges. The camera bump at the back protrudes a little even when the cover is on, may be a matter of concern. Please look for a Silicon cover to protect the camera module. PROCESSOR  -  This houses the newest chipset from MediaTek Helio G90T which is basically designed for gaming. This not only helps the phone to load & play high graphic intensive games fast & smooth, but it also helps in quick loading and swapping of Apps in a day to day usage. The overall performance is amazingly fast and buttery. Those who are complaining of heating issues, should buy ACs before buying phones for playing games for hours.. STORAGE & RAM  -  This comes with the fast UFS 2.1 onboard storage that help load apps ultra-fast, as compare to old eMMC 5.1 type storage. The basic model starts with 6 GB LPDDR4 RAM with Dual Channel Enabled. This helps increase the bandwidth by double the data rate as against the single channel RAM. Everything loads amazingly fast with no lags as such. Supports up to a whopping 512 GB of storage with a dedicated Micro SD Card slot. This is what we want in every phone… DISPLAY  -  6.53” IPS LCD Panel with 395 PPI density and 2.5D curved edges. This display is of a 1080 x 2340 Resolution with HDR Enabled so the colors look very vibrant and true to life. The water drop notch looks very nice and it can be disabled from settings. Personally, to me the display looked very crisp and sharp. The brightness of this display can go up to 430nits which is very bright and display looks amazingly sharp and crisp… 4k HDR video quality on YouTube is amazing on this display... CAMERA  -  This is where it exceeds all other phones. The default 12 MP Camera takes nice pictures in all modes. The 64 MP mode can be enabled from the camera app and it captures amazing pictures with great clarity colours and contrast. The pictures with 64 MP camera come out to be very crisp and with lots of details. But the image size for 64 MP camera would be approximately around 15 MB per picture. This can record the videos up to 4k Resolution. However, Full HD videos will have an Electronic Stabilization enabled by default which produces great videos. Macros also come very crisp considering that this is a Mobile camera but, not the DSLR. Front 20 MP Camera also captures wonderful selfies with lots of detail. This can record videos up to Full HD resolution. This phone does a great job in Camera department. This will surely satisfy your hunger for great pictures… Those who are looking for Gcam support, should take mobiles that support it or should buy google phones instead of complaining about this phone. The company has offered a good package with great camera and it does a wonderful job. People who are looking for an astonishing clarity Camera then they should look for a DSLRs or buy flagship phones. Attaching few pictures for reference… CONNECTIVITY  -  Supports Dual 4G VoLTE on both SIM Cards simultaneously. Dual Band Wi-Fi that increases both Upload and Download speeds dramatically if connected to Wi-Fi 5GHz connection. Comes with Bluetooth 5 with LE (Low Energy) mode on that helps preserve battery drain.. BATTERY  -  A Whopping 4500 mAh Battery with Quick Charge support. VERDICT  -  One Word – A Monster in all aspects, be it a Design, Style, Battery, Display and Camera. Except its weight of 200Gms, this is one piece of art and technology that nobody wants to miss having it… Every product will have their own issues and bugs, including flagships that can be fixed with a software update.  And every product cannot be compared with another since everything has its own existence and importance. Thanks to Amazon for safe packaging and fast delivery…","08 Nov 2019","Size name: 6+64GB Colour: Shadow Black","","Yes","Sarkhazi","5.0","Redmi Note 8 Pro (Halo White, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage with Helio G90T Processor)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Pro-Storage-Processor/product-reviews/B07X4PKGSN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"1 month user review.","It's a great product to have in this price range. Very sturdy design and comes with very good quality back cover. It really protect the phone when falls down. Camera quality is great outdoor and indoor. Speaker is very very good. Fingerprint scanner and face recognization works excellently. Battery last long, very long but dispit having c-type charger it take bit time to recharge fully. For average use/ non-gaming use it last for almost 2 n half day. Only thing I don't like is the weight of the phone. You feel the weight of the phone after some time specially if you are watching long videos n all. I got it in additional exchange value offer so I it's above the average value for money for me. It comes with one year complete protection so if you have kids in the house definitely buy this product. It has blue light filters do saves your child's eye sights.","12 Nov 2019","Colour: Mirror Black Size name: 3GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","JIGNESH SOLANKI","4.0","OPPO A5 2020 (Mirror Black, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Mirror-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B07SBK1WQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Excellent phone for my parents","I bought this phone for my parents as a gift, its been a week they haven't got any problem with this device so far from their prospective, great camera quality, and long battery life, great build quality, i highly recommend this phone for basic / average user. one thing This phone steps behind is for No fast charging feature, it would be so great to have such feature, anyway i was aware of this before buying so not an issue. the Other thing is that, this phone can be used as a battery bank for other phone, which is totally useless feature if anyone ask me, you have to buy additional wires for that too. BONUS! ColorOS contains bloatware that CANNOT be disabled (for just this, 1 star from review rating is reduced) I really really! hate to not have control over my phone, this thing actually encourage people towards rooting phone, the specific app I hated most is OPPO app market!! WHY? who use this? gladly i am not the user, my parents seems doesn't care about that. but anyway, Overall OPPO A5 2020 is great value phone for basic daily uses and some average gaming","09 Jun 2020","Colour: Dazzling White Size name: 3GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Burhanuddin Kalawadwala","4.0","OPPO A5 2020 (Mirror Black, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Mirror-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B07SBK1WQQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Midly disappointing, but can't expect much from a feature phone","First of all the design is oval like and hence feels old. There is no wireless FM. Misleading information by the seller. Also, i highly doubt there's 4G The buttons are small and hence harder to press, so might be difficult for old people The main center button is also difficult to press because there is no bevel or well defined edge to press on. But, the screen is big, battery life is good, and after all it's a Nokia, so it's built like a tank. Bit of a disappointment, since I owned the older 106, I think 2016 version...

"Excellent device for all basic use.","Extremely durable, very good battery life, clear and readable dispaly. Buttons are very soft to touch and light to press. Package includes handset, battery and micro usb charger. No headphones included but that is very much acceptable. Has inbuilt torch too. Speaker is not too loud but good enough. Only problem is you can not store multiple numbers under ine name. That's a bummer in todays world as almost every person has atleast 2 numbers.

"Not the Nokia I knew.","My grandparents have had a great experience with Nokia handsets. Good battery life, durable, good sound quality. That's all my grandma needed and it served the purpose. Of course these were purchased offline and at a time when smartphones were not dirt cheap. Guess now Nokia doesn't make em as they used to or inferior/faulty devices are being sold online. The day she received it, the call volume was low at her end but it was okay. But at the other end there was static. We tried different sims, different locations but still the same. Day 3 the call volume went down drastically and she couldn't hear a thing. She could hear if she tried really hard and pressed the phone against her ear. Totally disgusted by the product as it has been a nightmare for my grandparents during these tough times to get this phone working and no other means to contact. Being a prime member I assured them that the phone could be replaced if there were any problems but for some reason pick up wasn't available and they had to send the device back. I couldn't ask them to do that. It's harrasment and sending it through courier is next to impossible for those old souls. Very very disappointed. Never expected this from Amazon. Cannot rely on the service when I really need them.","07 Aug 2020","Colour: Blue","","Yes","Souvik Sikder","1.0","Nokia 105 2019 (Single SIM, Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-105-2019-Single-Black/product-reviews/B07YYNX5X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not worth the price","I bought this phone for my sister. Reviewing it after one week. Cons: 1. The plastic body is of very poor quality. It is like a plastic toy. 2. Phone is very bad in features. Even basic things are not covered. I have been using Samsung ET 1200 for an year and it has way lot of features than this like- There is no timer or stopwatch. It is there generally in every basic phone. Only alarm is there that also u have to fill it daily. there is no option like repeat everyday. U can only save one number under one name. If a contact has more than one number, u have to create a new contact to save that with a different name. There is no option to turn off the keypad light. No option to increase the font size. Font size in messages is pretty small. If you are planning to buy for anold aged person, please don't. Only dialed numbers appear in call button. If you want to check a miss call or received call u need to go in menu than select call logs. No optipns at all for ringtones, message tones, wallpapers etc. Pros: Fm is there. There are 3-4 games. Which is good for a basic phone. Overall, After using 2 basic phones I think samsung et-1200 in this range is much ahead in features and usability.","11 Jul 2020","Colour: Pink","","Yes","Prateek S.","2.0","Nokia 105 2019 (Single SIM, Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-105-2019-Single-Black/product-reviews/B07YYNX5X6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

And that contact number's are placed from first contact. 2. There many menus, which will deduct money if clicked by mistake. 3. Display quality is very poor. 4.

"Best price great featured smartphone","I want to buy low priced featured smartphone and found this and I didn't regret my purchase. It has great features at given price (5150 RS) in fact best phone to offer such features at price in current time. Screen: not best if you use Samsung amoled display or premium brand products but definitely its great at price. Touch, screen quality is good and won't regret. Performance: It's do job fantastic if you use for basic phone features, surfing and multiple tab is also good. I didn't feel any lagging. Performance is as good as xiaomi likes products. Battery : battery is just okay doesn't have much to offer. Battery life is not so great and hardly last for day If 4g data and location is on as it has only 2400 mAH capacity. Best part is its removable battery so could be easy to change in future if required. Charging is liitle slow and take much time to charge - no fast charging. It has micro USB ports. Fingerprint is very good responsive and face unlock works great. Face unlock capabilities is appreciable. Box includes phone, removable battery, charger, already applied Screen cover and TPU back cover with warranty card.

"Keep away from Amazon when it's Apple.","May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.","20 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","Suman Biswas","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"First Time iPhone User Review :-)","The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome. Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging. The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant). Cons: 1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears. 2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger. Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro). But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Sunny Kumar","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

"iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals","This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.","13 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Keshav Alur","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi]. After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it. Should provide Fast Charging.","30 Sep 2019","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Om Bishnoi","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Trust In Amazon, INTACT !","First i would like to write about the Online Shopping Platform : AMAZON. Amazon is and i believe will be the best and the most trusted e-commerce brands in the country. Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there. But my answer would be, GO FOR IT. I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC. No doubts remain anymore. Well that being said, nothing is permanent. I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone. Keep it up. Good delivery, on time. Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight. I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints. Delivery: Good. Product Packaging: Very Good. Notifications: Good. Shopping Experience: Good. About the product, well you guys, know about it very well already. One stop shop for all my shopping needs.

"Best thing that money can buy","Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys.

"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers.. Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years. Sound & Call Quality also Network Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent! Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection. Camera: The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P I would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!","02 Feb 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Jyotsna","3.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one. ✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry. ✅ All-day battery life. ✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance. ✅ Wireless charging ✅ An extra ultra-wide camera ✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now) ✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features. But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical. A high recommendation for this product.","27 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Saif Ur Rahman","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Minor damage to the product","There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it’s Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it . If not then I think I would not be buying any electronics product  from Amazon it better to buy from store co I can check everything on the spot .","21 Jul 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","Amazon Customer","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Defective model","hi I had purchased this phone in first week of June 2020 trusting amazon. But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to servers Finding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work fine but it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to work today while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not working I have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain","24 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","gaurav garg","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best in class","I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years. Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal. On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism. Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised. Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D. And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.","21 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Red","","Yes","Adithya Gopikrishnan","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Black","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Black/product-reviews/B07XVMDRZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"One trillion operations per second","Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life.

My earlier redmi note 5 pro is working fine for last two years and no such issue with my earlier phone.

"Good Phone at 9k","I have been using it for a week. I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better. The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations. The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher. Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance.

"Good phone at this price","I am writing this review after using the product for 3 weeks. Its my first time with Vivo and I must say it didn't disappointed me. I have been using Samsung/Motorola/ and Redmi over few years and all of the products had pros and cons. PROS: 1) Very Strong battery:  It has a 4500 mah battery but still its better than my Samsung M30 5000 mah battery. Its one of the best till now whatever I have used. After heavy usage still it can manage 1.5 days which is quite awesome. 2) full of features and options to customize 3) Liked the looks and comfortable to handle (as I felt my Redmi note was little heavy on the top so always it felt like toppling from my hand. Anyway design is person specific so I leave it to everybody 4) Face/finger both are working quite fast 5) 8GB RAM and 128GB storage at this price is icing on the cake 6) Mobile screen guard and back cover comes with the mobile are of good quality CONS: 1) Little heavy than my Motorola but still manageable 2) Not sure about the camera as I have taken only few pictures which are quite normal","22 Jun 2020","Colour: Mystic Black Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Vivo S1 Pro (Mystic Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-TST_Exclusive1043-3GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07S6BW832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Waste of Money....NEVER BUY THIS PHONE","I bought this product Trusting  the Big Name of VIVO but I was disappointed with the phone. Initially I got it replaced by another one, assuming that there was something worng with that piece of phone but the next one is the same ... The following features of the phone is not upto mark as expected:- 1. Camera is not like 48Mp or 32 Mp ... It's like 20Mp and 16Mp respectively.. Pictures get blurred on zooming.. 2. Battery dies out soon ..Again apprently it seems that instead of 4500 mah they've inserted some 3000 mah battery. 3. The phone is very slow in Fingerprint reading, Net browsing, Call conneting and you doesn't feel ever that you're using a 8GB RAM phone...Although I've kept a very few apps it runs slowly.. Even during data transfer from my chip it took long to transfer 20 GB data .. Aprox 2.5 hours.. Finally If you're paying this much money for this useless piece of Phone better you take two phones for yourself with same quality of features (in lesser configured phone) NEVER EVER PURCHASE THIS PHONE !!!!!!!","29 Jul 2020","Colour: Dreamy White Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Alisha Kumari","1.0","Vivo S1 Pro (Mystic Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-TST_Exclusive1043-3GB-Storage/product-reviews/B07S6BW832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Its a complete Beast !!! Awesome mobile","I think I am the first one to write a review for this beauty :)  I ordered this at 11 PM in the night and It was there in my hand in the morning 9 AM. I have used iPhone X, Samsung s9 plus and Samsung s10 plus before coming to One Plus 7T.  My experience so far with this: 1. Display: It's amazing. Sharpness, brightness and 90Hz displays makes it one of the most beautiful displays. 2. Camera: All of my previous mobiles had great cameras. 7t Pro is nothing less than that. If you are a professional photographer, you might find differences. For a normal user, it's just perfect. 3. Battery: I am getting a very good battery backup. When I go to bed, it's 30%. 30T Warp charger is a booom. 4. Performance: Blazing and Lightning fast. 5. One of the USP of OnePlus mobiles is its Oxygen OS. After using iPhone and Samsungs One UI, I can tell you that it's the best. Lots of gestures, shortcuts and very lightweight. The only Con I think it has is its weight. It's on the heavier side but after using it for few days now, I am getting used to it. Go for it guys !! You won't regret.","15 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","BunnyDecoder","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The Best Smartphone of 2019 | The Flagship King","==== A lengthy & brutally honest review. It's worth the read if you plan on purchasing this device. ==== I am a Design Specialist by Profession & also into Mobile Photography, hence I was hooked in using the Pixel 2XL. This phone is a worthy upgrade if you're transitioning from Galaxy S9 / Pixel 1 or 2 series / OnePlus 6, 6T & below / iPhone X or 7 and below. OnePlus 7T Pro is only an incremental upgrade over it's predecessor OnePlus 7 Pro. ===== What has been improved over the 7 Pro? ==== + Faster Processor. Snapdragon 855 Plus. + Adreno 640. Better Gaming Performance. + Better Haptic Motor. Same as the 7T. + Fast Charging. Warp 30T Technology. + Brighter Nits (Upto 1000 compared to 800 of 7 Pro) + Super Macro Mode, Night reading Modes, Android 10 out of the box, Better Nightscape 2.0. These software updates will be eventually updated for the 7 Pro as well. ==== What's in the Box? ==== OnePlus 7T Pro Device. User Manual. Transparent Silicon Case. SIM Ejector Tool. Warp 30T Charging Brick. Type C USB Cable. And some cool OnePlus Stickers. ==== Display ==== Firstly, OnePlus 7T Pro has a stunning display over its predecessors. I'm personally not a fan of notches nor do I click a lot of selfies, so I prefer the OnePlus 7T Pro's Fluid Display. Feels more luxurious over the 7T. It's marginally bigger to hold as well. I would recommend using a case so that the edges don't feel slippery. However, you should also note that in different lighting conditions, 7T Pro has glares at the curves due to the rounder corners which I believe is negligible. 90Hz is smoooooth. You would never want to get back to 60Hz once you're used to this. ==== Performance ==== Snapdragon 855 Plus is one of the best CPUs out there (at the time of writing this review) and with Adrena 640, it takes gaming and multi-tasking to another league. COD & PUB-G juices out at their best with 60FPS & is indeed smooth than imagined. 855 Plus is at par with the A13 Bionic from Apple. Haven't experienced any drops in frames. RAM Management is splendid & 8GB RAM is recommended unless you want to get the 12 Gig McLaren Edition to save on a few seconds everyday. ==== Camera ==== I honestly have to admit that it's not the best out there as I was expecting a leap from it's predecessors. It still uses the Sony IMX 586 (48 MP) for it's main sensor and it's Telephoto at 2.2X optical (3X lossless) and is at par with iPhone. But when compared with the GCam Mod, the OnePlus Camera seems to have improved a lot from it's previous versions. The Wide Angle is fairly okayish with some distortions being present at the edges. Nightscape is now available for Wide Angle shots too. ==== Video ==== If you're into Video Recording, then be a bit disappointed to hear this as it isn't the best while it can still take average videos without much shake utilizing the OIS and EIS at 1080P and just OIS at 4K 60FPS. It still doesn't shoot 4K in wide angle. Apple iPhone 11 takes the lead here. OIS and EIS combined together has a lot of warping and rolling shutter which is a turn off for video producers. It's still not an alternate for a Gimbal. The videos look oversaturated too which can be fixed by shooting on a Third Party app like Filmic Pro. ==== Software ==== This is one of the biggest features for you to switch to the OnePlus. Stock Android was butter smooth while I missed out on a lot of simple gestures like Longer Screenshots, Silence Button, Customized Navigational elements & much more which lacked on the Stock OS from Google. I would say Oxygen OS should be set as a benchmark for Google to include these incremental features on their upcoming flagships. Oxygen OS has presently the best OS Experience for Android. ==== Battery ==== Warp T30 is super fast. It helps you charge from 0-100 in lesser time than an episode on Netflix. Although not the fastest charger in the industry, it still gets through a day on heavy usage. ==== What could've been improved ==== - Minor improvements on Camera. - No ToF sensor - No Wireless Charging. - IP Rating. - Better silicon case should be included in their future upgrades. ==== Verdict ==== No doubt that the ASUS Fans would recommend the ROG 2. ROG 2 is hands down the best gaming phone with 120 HZ Display but lacks majorly on other aspects like software updates, Telephoto Camera, Splash Proof, Build Quality and security patches which are very essential for business professionals or regular consumers. ASUS is also not known to provide regular updates to it's consumers over the OnePlus which has a closely knit community among the developers and has more Brand Value than ASUS & nevertheless to mention that the OnePlus 7T Pro feels premium out of the box. If you're planning to upgrade from a device almost 2 years old then this would be the best upgrade in case you require a phone with no-notch and curved screen. 7T Pro feels very slippery when compared to the 7T. I wish they made smaller devices. Otherwise I would still recommend the 7T which is the best bang for your buck. If you still wish to own this but cannot afford the extra rupee on incremental updates (Fast Charging, 855 Plus) , my suggestion would be is to go for the OnePlus 7 Pro. It's still one of the best devices out there.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Rinse John","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Kindly Update the Camera Quality with next software updates","Hi, When I open my this most awaited phone, I just saw 2 major Draw Back 1st.

The zoom quality is very poor, pic are RIP-UP,DURING ZOOM SHOT OR WHEN YOU SEE THE CAPTURED IMAGE WITH ZOOM. NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY AND SHOT IS ALSO POOR IN NIGHT PICTURES YOU SAW LOTS OF DOTS- RIP-UP.

"Perfect combination of OnePlus 7T and 7Pro","Amazing phone with an unbelievably smooth and vivid display. I had been using the OnePlus 5T before and a big fan of OnePlus cameras and OS.But I've always felt the OnePlus display wasn't good enough.This mobile just killed that thought. Highlights: 1)Buttery smooth, fast and bright display -The edge display is just wowwww. You just can't stop admiring it. 2)Excellent camera - The pictures come out so well in all kinds of lighting and modes. *Portrait*- The new zoom mode in portrait is just wow.Looks exactly like DSLR clicks. Macro - I love taking closeup shots of flowers and patterns and with this...you can get as close as 2.5 cms and click amazing shots. Nightscape - This area is a huge upgrade compared to my OnePlus 5t.You get crisp and clear pictures without any noise.The pictures are now to the mark of Pixel mobiles. Popup camera - If you are hesitant or doubtful about popup cameras...I am telling you there is nothing to worry...It is Soo smooth and quick that you never will notice it is a hardware controlled camera.Selfies have never been this better.Bright and sharp shots anytime. Video - Haven't really used much.Will update later 3)Dolby speakers - Excellent sound quality with awesome stereo effect.Once again a huge upgrade over the older models. 4)90 Hz refresh rate - Yes this one gives you a totally different experience when using your mobile.It is clearly faster and better than the usual 60Hz displays. 5)Build and design - Just perfect...It's sleek...stylish and neat. Loved the camera setup in OnePlus 7T but hated the circular bump.And I totally loved the edge display in OnePlus 7 pro.This device is just a perfect combination of the best features in the 7t and the 7pro and NOT an unwanted model like everyone is claiming. 6) Batter and charging - The charging is blazing fast and the battery very easily lasts a whole day,even with 90Hz refresh rate.","17 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Abirami","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I am in love with it.... But After 2 days of normal usage and random navigation on the device. The device started rebooting itself, I was shocked but thought maybe just after reboot it will ok. But it rebooted for 3 hours continuously without any stop, till the whole battery got drained. I was not able to perform any action, it made me handicapped for 3 hours, where I cannot do anything...

You have to get registered on their website. Why?! Display seems to have a bit of yellow tint. Although fast, not really seeing the so called magic of 90Hz display. Overhyped. Curved edges make reading a bit weird: Lines go up from the left (curve on the left), then flat in the middle and then go down on the right(curve on the right)- Wish the OS provided a margin on both edges,if needed.","18 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","AmazonCustomer","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The first Review,  here's what you need to know...","Being one of the first people getting their hands on the New Oneplus 7T pro sounds amazing.... But after using for a day this is what I found. .. Cons : 1) Heats up quickly 2) If on a video call ( whatsapp)  unable to use whatsapp properly getting hung it screen frozen 3) Battery drains out a bit fast. In 15 hours battery came from 100% to 35 % off which I slept for 8 hours with Wi-Fi and internet on. 4) The set is very slippery, you will need a case. 5) I assume there is a bug which keeps going to the main menu when I'm trying to surf any app. Pros : 1) Amazing Camera 2) Very fast battery charging. 3) The case that comes with the package is very rubbery and not hard but it has a very good grip. 4) Handset already comes with a screen guard. 5) The screen display is one of the best. 6) Very fast processor. And able to open simultaneous apps without compromising speed and performance. I hope this has helped ppl..  I will get some more reviews once I use this set more.  Cheers.  As a whole buy this for the experience. Or you can just wait for the Mclaren edition of you like a darker and more Ram speed.  Else I would say go for it.

"Review after few Day Usage..","Earlier I was one plus 5T That time i 100% Satisfied  ,That was last one plus member i have been used after that I bought Note 9(Samsung) which was another incredible Phone in my life but after after 2 month I sold that mobile reason was 1: Big Size (Not Fit in Pocket) 2: Battery was big but drainage was too fast. So the next mobile came in my life was iPhone xs max (256 gb) Guys that was another beast but but ..........again my daily life suffering with few problem which might be small for other but big for me. 1: Two whatsapp (reguler and business) was not on iphone 2: IRCTC official app was not there. 3 : Really not easy to assess my iphone file and documents on laptop (Hp) So finally i decided to change my iphone to another android device that is ONE PLUS 7T pro. Few more mobile was in my mind which was 1: Ascus ROG 2 2:Samsung  S10 Plus 3:OP 7T 4: Upcoming pixel 4 But i choosen OP 7T Pro Why? During usage of last few mobile i was really missing fast charging like i was having OP 5T Why i left above phone Because 1:Ascus rog is bit heavy and not for daily usage also not available since long due to out of stock. 2:Samsung is ,hhhmmm  same phone what i left with note 9 and  S10+ is bit older for now if i am going to invest money. 3: OP 7T is Old Design (according to me) also I really bored with NOTCH..NOTCH GAME 4: Google really not Made Pixel4 what i expected specially front Design.again big border line design. Sooooooo Now using OP 7T Pro ,Points Are 1: Battery , yes not great but not bad as critics are giving their review.good for Daily usage. Just understand guys OP can give us bigger 5K -6K Battery  but not making such big battery phone ,reson behind this was that More Big Battery really take much more time than what we expected from OP. Also 4085 MAH is sufficient ,really good for Daily need .2 Days battery life are just bluff even 6K MAH battery ROG is not giving 2 Days battery backup. 2:Display : Great ! The highlighted point what i fall upon on OP7T Pro is its Display .tooooo Saxy and amaze to experience. 3:Fast Charging : I think this is the reply if any one asking for big battery. I am Travelling centric person ,suppose i visited any of my clients/Place for 30 Min in a day so i can get my phone charged for 60-70% immediately that no phonce can perform like that. So understand All new Develop 30T Wrap Charger is biggest Pro of OP 7T Pro. Tooooo fast. 4:No Notch : Even in Latest Iphone having ugly notch believ me phone not having notch looking more beautiful that any notch phone. Especially when you watching videos or Doing any excel work. 5: Ultra fast Oxigen OS: feel i using Stock android experience.So no Discussion for this. 6:855+ Snap Dragon : Don't be hype but it's is similer A13 Chip.Only in few matter A13 won like vedio randering etc which 99% People don't needed. 7: good network Reception :Yes ,I was blindly believe that Samsung Mobile having (S10+) best network Reception in industry but first time OP performance is really amazing. 8:Voice Quality:Similer to iphone so no complain. 9Vibration Motor: I still give 1st Rank to Apple devices  because vibration lavel of any iphone is best in industry but this time OP did somthing amazing with their devices OP 7T pro having different motor which is 90%Similer to Iphone. 10:Camera : frankly says here i feel compromise because earlier i was having XS max iphone which was far ahead than this device ,yes micro mode is something exiting for me. CON : 1: Big Phone :So before making any decisions just understand this is a BIG phone 2: Sleepery Design : if you are a person that using phone while driving (2 Wheelers), putting in halmet while biking so this will not fullfill your requirements because of it Saxy design. This is the phone where in office meeting you can put on table afore all employees and showoff. 3: Nothing More just one request /Suggestions to OP that stay on your previous policy to launch single device in a year. My few friends bought OP 7 pro just 3 month Ago and now OP launches these 2 phones 7T and 7T pro. Now Maclaren.....So OP we indian belief on brands so don't changes policy that customer felt they cheated. So Guys this is my all details on this device and my prior devises.hope you all enjoyed to take this before going to expens your bucks.","24 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Deepak Kumar Tiwari","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Official type c to 3.5 mm jack converter is not working. Oneplus service center said problem with type c port. And device need to be opened to replace the port. If some other problem arises since they opened the device after warranty then I need to spend out of my pocket to service it. Amazon pointing oneplus and one plus pointing Amazon.

"Worth Buying in 2020?","This is a detailed review of OnePlus 7T Pro and I'll explain if it's worth buying in 2020. This phone was released in October 2019..and I bought this device in 2020 because most of the specs are still worth paying money for. Camera :- 4.5/5 Battery :- 4.5/5 Display :- 5/5 ( Qhd + 90Hz Amazing ) In 2020 even though OnePlus launched it's 8 series..we already saw 8 Pro having serious issues. Talking about OnePlus 8 , it is the base model in the 8 Series..with SD 865 the latest one .. but Last year's 855+ in 7T Pro is never too behind compared to the performance offered. If talking about camera I'll blindly choose the 7T pro over 8 , macro lens with 2 MP in OP 8 is of no use...where at the same time we are able to shoot close up pics in 7T pro with the Software based Macro mode...which offers more detailed images than the OP 8 . Battery is slightly larger in 8 4300 mAh compared to 4085 in 7T pro...still not a big difference.. My OP 7T pro easily gets me through a full day with moderate use...when we have a 30 watt charger it's not a case to worry about anyway...it charges 0-100 in about 1 hour 10 minutes (Tested). Gaming ... games will run in high settings... PUBG and COD mobile...tested and it's awesome. Display OnePlus 8 and 7T pro has 90 Hz display Where 8 comes with FHD+ resolution while 7T pro comes with QHD Resolution... If u need Better Camera and Display go for 7T pro If u need the latest processor and slightly bigger battery go for OnePlus 8 . 7T Pro was last year's Flagship while 8 is the base model. So obviously 7T pro is worth buying in 2020..Trust me whoever is confused which OnePlus to buy...Go for it.. I don't think we need to compare it with iPhone SE😅..","23 May 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Vishnu Sankar","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Lovely Phone","Fabulous phone really. The display is amazing. The full screen without bezels looks vibrant and very attractive. The built in quality is very good. This is actually a bit heavy than is expected, gives that premium feel. Screen is super responsive and as the refreshment rate is 90 Hz, this is very fast. The 8GB ram is more than enough. Gaming is also excellent. The battery is giving easy full day in a single charge and the charging is super quick. Overall a brilliant phone. The Camera is also very good. Both rare and front cameras are up to the mark. You can always use that Pro mode to get the best of this camera.","25 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Subhasish","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Average for price point","Writing review after using oneplus 7t pro for couple of days. Pro 1.Very good curved display with nice punchy colors, this is the only one thing to buy this instead of 7t 2.best sound till now for any mobile I used 3.good haptic feedback, feels solid 4.battery is good, for average use it gave me 7+hrs of SOT till it die. Warp charger fulls battery in 1hr from 0 to 100. 5.smooth and fast. Coming from LG G6 definitely feels an upgrade Con 1.camera is awful, both front(motorized is one of the downside) and back. Macro mode is fun to play with. My old LG G6 takes good pics that this 2.feels heavy when used for long time. 3.no use of edge screen as Samsung does with their own 4. Fingerprint reader is hit and miss. 5. Slippery and feels delicate 6. Headset or 3.5mm adapter should have included in box If you are confuse between op7t and this phone then only screen is deciding point. Hopefully gcam will improve main weak point of this phone","21 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Amazon Customer","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best in the market","This phone excels other phones (even those with double the price) in many aspects. The screen is just unmatchable. Forget about specs, just watch a 4K video on YouTube and you will understand. The charging is super fast. I just charged my phone from 20% to full charge in 30 minutes. The selfie camera is top notch. Better than iPhone 11 Pro Max. The back camera has a macro mode also, so if you're into that kind of photography, it's a plus. The audio is super loud and the quality is also not that bad. So if you are hesitant to buy cheap speakers, this is the deal. Add to that the 90Hz refresh rate. You won't notice this after switching to this phone, but you definitely cannot go back to a 60Hz after using this. The only thing that could have been better is the battery life. It's not bad by any means, but the 90Hz refresh eats up the battery more than expected. You can also switch to 60Hz if needed.","16 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Rikayan","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Battery is good and Warp charger is awesome, screen is completely mind blowing. Front and back cameras speaks alot as  trade Mark OnePlus shots but slow motion capture is bit disappointing. Rather than spending on iPhone 11pro Max you can have OnePlus 7t pro especially McLaren edition I just Love it to the core. So stylish and attractive model, a perfect premium phone.

"Cost is too much compared to 7 pro. I wasted 11k extra for no reason.","I bought this I phone on last week and it is delivered on time. Thanks to Amazon. After I bought I came to know that I made a big mistake buying 7t pro because I didn't find a big difference than 7 pro. Only for two differences I have paid 11k extra which is not worth. Two differences are battery slightly big and snapdragon 55plus I request you guys if are planning to buy this phone pls do not go for it instead you have same feature and feel in OnePlus 7 pro. I am big fan of one plus and I will , but thought of write some economically helpful review to all of you. If you want research more on the comparison and buy. This the biggest mistake I did.

But main thing which is most dis-pointed about 7T series is heating issue, i bought 7T earlier but it had heating issue, so returned back, and later bought 7T pro Maclern edition, but this phone also has heating issue (not regularly like 7T) but it happen some times. So as per my usage i recommend iPhone rather than this phone.","05 Nov 2019","","","Yes","Amazon Customer","3.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Won't recommend it.","Hey, I have never felt so unsatisfied with any of your handsets like the way I feel using your latest oneplus7t pro, I mean I have used OnePlus 3t, one plus5t , but have never experienced such problems during their usage, I mean I don't want to offend your innovation, but still, the edges are so tricky that whenever you have to close a window and the close buttons at the corner, you really have to try pressing it multiple times, this piece hangs a lot, like a lot, I really think this device is abnormal and incompatible for usage, it has already taken peace of my mind and I would really not suggest anyone around me to buy this phone, it's the price I paid for when I bought this handset, it has lot of problems, and the phone is making me incompetent at work can you believe this.","04 May 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Tejas Mardolkar","1.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"One hell of a phone Second best OnePlus phone after 8Pro","First of all I would like to tell you that I ordered One plus 8 Pro but due to display issues I had to return it back. I ordered this 7TPro when I was about to purchase 7Pro but thanks to Amazon due to 3000 cash back and offers applied I got this phone for 42,600/- . This was surely a pretty good deal as I got almost latest device with few compromises. Coming to phone 1. Camera : You will not be pleased but I bet you will also not be disappointed. It's a good camera with many features up it's sleeve. 2. Battery : Yes battery is a let down but for a decent user at least me I charge it to 80 percent only and get a whole days life and need to charge it again in the evening, ate evening 3. Display : That's a butter smooth experience especially with 90Hz and QHD+ you really will love it and obviously will never want to go back to 60Hz. One plus 8 Pro had 120 Hz that was also something I loved. 4. OS : Oxygen OS is very light and user friendly. You can use gestures to stop music many other features without unlocking it. Other features include nice shortcuts and customisations according to taste. HORIZON LIGHT seriously wow. 5. Sound : Sound quality is also decent and may be better than most of Oppo ViVo phones but not at par with iPhone. 6. Charger : Nice charging speed though I am not sure it compromises on battery life. I charge it to 80% only. 7. Bluetooth sound I have Noise shots X5 Pro and Amazon Prime Music . The aptxHD sound is seriously mind blowing . No heating or display issues was faces by me. Some shortcomings 1. Battery and camera are two fields where OnePlus can really look back for improvement. 2. I was shown a different date in OnePlus care app but talking to service center and Amazon executive I was assured that even though the device date was inadvertently shown of Jan 2020 I will be given service based on July 2020 purchase date","25 Jul 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Ankur Yadav","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

If you switch to FHD & 60hz it'll last you more than a day but if you do that what's the point of even buying this phone??)

"Not worth for the price even after discount!","It is one of the very good phones available in the market. Screen : it has a curved full screen without a notch. The screen looks very impressive. The brightness and sharpness of the screen is nice and displays colors very accurately. It is a QHD screen with 90Hz display rate. Fingerprint Sensor : The fingerprint sensor is under the display and does a decent job. Though I found it to be a bit slow than the physical fingerprint sensor as on Oneplus 5. Battery : the battery is good enough to last a full day with decent load. It is fast charging so gets charged to give couple of hours charge within few minutes. Camera: The front has a pop-up camera and back has 3 cameras. The front pop-up camera closes is a free fall is detected. Good Job oneplus!. I will not get into the technical megapixels of it as it is widely known. The front camera does a good job for selfies and video calls. The back camera output images were real disappointment! The photos missed sharpness throughout. Got blurry on very little zoom-in. Tried all possible settings with the phone/app but the back camera kept disappointing. Older oneplus phones have a lot better back camera. Even the cheaper Samsung has better camera quality. Software : The oxygen OS does a very good job. It provides a lot of customization and also keeps up the support for a long time. Overall : Disappointed with the product as a whole for the price I paid. Not worth it!","06 Jul 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","s. c.","3.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Overrated product","Earlier i has Samsung A7(2018)- 128 GB model. I must say A7 is much better smartphone in terms of Camera image processing, PRACTICALITY, Durability etc. Pros of 1plus: 1. Battery durability 2. Back camera 3. Processor speed 4. Battery Charging 5. Display Picture quality Cons: 1. Pop up selfie camera:  both in terms of quality and practicality 2. Default Video, mp3 media player and image display application 3. Position of Volume buttons and Power button is bit awkwrd. Conclusion: My Samsung A7 smartphone is far better, given its price. I guess i was swayed by all that glistering around Oneplus mobile phones. I am looking to purchase smartphone for my dad in range of 20k-30k, will go for Samsung smartphone instead of upcoming Oneplus Nord definitely. PS. i had purchase the product before Indo-china border dispute. Big mistake. It's all branding and advertisement.","27 Jul 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","kumar jyoti","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"If you're an average user then read this. Awesome phone but may not the best for you.","Guys.. It's an awesome phone when you look at it alone. It feels better in few or many factors when compared to K20 PRO, 7 PRO side by side. I have a 6gb k20 Pro for my wife. Here's what I observed. Pros# Beautiful 90hz no notch display. Once you go 90, you'll never go back to 60Hz. Stereo speakers 855+, 8gb ram with Oxygen is the one of the fastest and finest Android out there. Curved edge is love. Though it's subjective. Quick charge. If you come from Apple background like me. You'd find t even the iPad charger useless. Honestly this was something I did not know I was missing. lol Moving parts on your phone - the motor camera. It's a bad thing to have a moving part yet it's been tested and said that it stays in tact upto 5 years even with 150 opens a day. So you'd not keep the phone for 5 years. Do you? If you're not a frequent selfie guy then this is it. Pro models are for you. And there are other 100 Android features that I can list but not required here. Cons# Heavy. If you keep using this phone for talking for more than 20 mins, your wrist tells you to cut down. No reachability for one hand access. I know big screen is a must in 2019 trend but without usability it's a waste. Curved edge - I know it's a con as well. When using one handed your palm touches screen edges before your finger reaches wherever you want to. And voilà, something that you never expected. Camera - Since I come from Apple and Samsung background I found the camera not so great. But for the price you pay should not complain mate. It's not as great as iPhone 11 series but it's there. As a normal guy who clicks pics while he's on trip, birthdays etc . It gets your job done. Gcam does fix the job so relax guys. Better than OP7 Pro? Meh, not really. Unless you're a guy who roots and explores too much. You won't even know the difference. Except the macro mode on camera which is useful but not useful. Get it? If you're just a typical guy who used for WhatsApp, Insta, calls and stuff then 7T would do it. If you don't want a notch like me 7 Pro will do. If you want latest hardware thinking future software support is great, snob value and don't mind spending extra money then 7T Pro it is. If you don't care what skin the Android has.. go for K20 Pro.","16 Nov 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Sangamesh Hiremath","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A Premium Beast with Class","I am writing this review after 2 months of usage. I will try to break this review basis various features. Overall Experience- 5/5 The overall phone usage is exceptional. No lags, the phone has never hanged even once. The 90HZ refresh rate makes the phone usage smoother and enhances overall touch and usage experience. Snapdragon 855+ with 8GB Ram are the premium specs available in the phone today. It adds to the lag free experience. Camera 4/5: One Plus has come a long way with the enhancement of camera. The Day Light photographs are one of the finest among the premium segment phones. Wide angle camera as well as the regular camera click amazing pictures during daylight. The added Macro Photography feature is a plus plus in the overall usage. The colors are almost tending to Natural colors in the photographs. One Plus is ensuring with every update it improves the camera. The front pop up camera is also amazing. Very fast pop up and the selfie picture quality is really good. I deducted one point for Night Photography. Here it still needs to make improvements to reach Pixel phone night mode. I. Hopeful it will improve in future updates. Battery - 5/5 The battery backup is the USP of this phone. I have close to 150 apps on my phone. I usually get around 28 hours of battery usage with decent to heavy usgae. This might come down if u play games. But still it would be good enough to last you a day. And the 30T warp charging is a breeze. Charging phone for 30 mins and you almost get the phone charged till 70-75% from 1-2% battery. Another Plus in the phone. Screen 5/5 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone usage awesome. There are 3 modes you can use to handle your screen colors. With no NOTCH, the phone is completely bezeless. This makes the phone viewing experience amazing. I am using a curved screen for first time and I am loving thisore than flat screen usage. the graphics are just superb while playing Games. It s a different enhanced experience with Fnatic Mode. Performance 5/5 With Snapdragon 855+, the phone is super fast to use. And 8GB Ram, makes handling phone with multi tasking buttery smooth. No lags at all. The Fnatic mode makes Gaming experience just Wow. Am playing Asphalt 9, PubG, Clash of Clans on phone. Even after a continuous usage of 45 mins to 1 hour, the phone doesn't heat up. Looks 5/5 And lastly the looks. The Haze Blue makes the phone look very premium. While it weights 206 Gms but with the daily usage it doesn't feel weight at all. The no NOTCH and Full display is a plus plus in the phone. If you are looking for a Beast in this segment, One Plus 7T Pro would be the right choice for you. You will not regret your choice at all.","11 Jan 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Pratik","5.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"It's a much hyped mobile","It's a much hyped mobile. The finger scanner is very bad compared to OnePlus 3 (that i was using beforing buying 7T Pro). With new latest processor, i didn't find any difference between OnePlus 3 and 7T Pro. Not sure how others are comparing. Secondly, I feel No difference after upgrading, apart from design, look and cosmetics. Though i find camera is better. I really donot understand, why the battery is really bad, just lasting for a day. And another important observation as compared to OnePlus 3 is that 7T Pro stucks gives the feeling of less power sometimes.","05 Jan 2020","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Santosh D Belawadi","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointing Battery Life with Network issues and poor selfie","Dislikes: 1. Poor selfie camera. I captured a few screens at the selfie was bad during night time and during day time over exposed. 2. Poor battery life barely remains a day. If you are travelling ends up loosing power very very soon with very moderate usage. Make sure to find charging points in airports or else you will end up with ZERO battery. (I have done everything and only WhatsApp direct messages run in background, all apps and all whatsapp group notifications are stopped in background). 3. Network issues which is most disappointing. I was missing calls and people were saying we tried but it was saying switched off. 4. No official screen guard available in OnePlus stores. I got a case for Rs. 1490 which had 1+ branding and looked good but no screen guard for my curved phone. Likes: 1. Good quality screen with 90 Hz display. 2. Several additional features like ambient display and wake up by tap, navigational gestures in OnePlus which was missing in my Vivo Nex previous phone 3. Simple UI and better Oxygen OS than stock Android 4. Good built quality and better in looks than iPhone 11.","14 Nov 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Shri","3.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Quality product, battery n camera could have been better to be the best","A review from a buyer switching from 1+ 5 to 7t pro. Physically phone looks good but is on the heavier side which first thing to notice the moment you hold it. It takes time to get use to it. Screen/ display is superb one of onePlus's best uptil now. For me Samsung has got one of best screens but this is one model which can compete on display. Plus you get full screen with 90hrz refresh rate which is simply awesome n you do feel difference. Pop up camera is good but over time i beleive it might be difficult to maintain as there is a possibility of dust particles entering it n you might end up cleaning lens before click. Cameras in general are pretty good and would have been best if Samsung S10 (also Apple) wouldn't be there. But at this price cameras are good. Warp charger in the box is amazing and charges superfast. But i woild like to mention about battery that it is ok not that it will last too long. I was expecting a good battery life which i got when there were no apps installed initially. Eventually when I loaded the phone fully I noticed the difference, earlier it was around 37% in 20 hour later 20%in 20 hours, considering heavy use, pretty decent still. Best part is OnePlus strives to improve so the above cons like battery life, camera I believe the company will keep providing updates to improve and they keep upgrading your OS quite fast, faster than other companies. A good quality product overall.","22 Oct 2019","Colour: Haze Blue Size name: 8GB RAM+256GB Storage","","Yes","Ameesh Bisaria","4.0","OnePlus 7T Pro (Haze Blue, 8GB RAM, Fluid AMOLED Display, 256GB Storage, 4085mAH Battery)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-749/product-reviews/B07DJ8K2KT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Overall I like this but only Dispointing thing is i received different colour set.","15 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Arun Pandey","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-557/product-reviews/B077PWJ8RS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Got an premium look but storage....!!","Redmi note 9 pro max got an premium look It has an 5200 mah battery and awsome camera.. 64 gb internal storage is company offering but we only get 48 gb comparing to other products of mi and other smartphone brand it is too low..! As storage of an smartphone is important to an coustomer. As the camera of redmi note 9 pro max is 64 mega pixel it will lead to fill the 48 bg intrrnal storage easily. Other properties of redmi note 9 pro max is same as other redmi smartphones exclude android 10.0. As redmi's camera is outstanding compared to other smartphones in this level price range redmi note 9 pro max is adorable.. I recommend 128 gb internal storage device for our good and smooth use.","12 Jun 2020","","","Yes","ROSEMOL","3.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-557/product-reviews/B077PWJ8RS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A very capable phone","1) Design Pros It has been by far the best design redmi has brought to a phone. The *Aura Balance Design* they said is almost true to believe because it has got weight balance throughout the device. Cons -The camera bump behind the phone is a bit annoying because of it rocking on the table. -A little bit of screen bleeding can be seen on the phone but it is negligible for the price point. 2) Performance It has been an issue with me since I dont game a lot. The processor is very efficient in its 8nm architecture. 3) MIUI It is having a mild lag between switching the apps and have occasional bugs. Hope they rectify it in their update. 4) Camera For this point, I cannot ask for a better camera. It has a very capable samsung GW1 sensor which gives almost accurate picture. And also it was good to know that it provides the bokeh or the portrait mode for objects like dogs. 5) Battery This is an enormous 5020mah battery which proves to be a beast in any scenario. I got 7 hour Screen on Time with just 50% depleted. ( I dont game on my phone) . And also the charging is the area where this outperforms like a champ. 1hour 12minutes is all it takes to charge from 0-100. Overall Experience It is a good price-to-value phone.","16 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Parikshith Krishnan","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-557/product-reviews/B077PWJ8RS/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Decent package under 20k","Overall it's a good package under 20k, but still at its price point company should provide at least 90hz refresh rate,camera also good in day light shots but what will be the use of 64 mp when it's not take good photos in low light . It just all about company marketing. I would suggest that don't give us 64mp camera but provide good and balanced camera which takes good images in both day and night shots.

"Better go for Redmi Note 9 pro......","I am reading other reviews and I am surprised. May be I got a defective one. In detail, First issue I have is with speaker loudness which is less than average, u can't hear ringtone if u r in another room. 2ndly with the battery, I am getting a lower battery talktime compared to what reviewers show in their YouTube videos. With camera u can sometime click a nicer shots and sometimes it's horrible to believe it's a 64mp shooter. If u r going for a camera phone definitely this is not the one. Now with the performance, Sometimes it freezes within the app. Now it's up to buyer if u r intended to buy this then no review can stop u from buying...","13 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Nishant","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-557/product-reviews/B077PWJ8RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great Device","Good Phone. Those who say that its costly , its only because of GST hike which is 18% on electronics etc. Redminote9promax is a handy phone to buy and gives you an amazing  performance with big battery. Though it has a massive 5020 mAh battery, The phone doesn't feel much heavy as expected. Camera performance is Good and satisfying. Backside of the phone is so premium that you don't wanna put a cover . But glass is glass and glass breaks so I recommend to cover it with a case ( given in the box) . Game booster on this phone works absolutely well and doesn't let the phone to heat more. Allover its a great value for money device and I recommend  the viewers to buy it .

"Mediocre Phone with high publicity stunt.","Seriously suggesting, please don't buy. After a long hussle and fake publicity stunt of flash sale, I was finally able to purchase one and guess what, it is just a mediocre phone with highly advertised by Redmi. I would recommend go for samsung M31 in this range. I have personally compared and found this phone's performance too mediocre as compared to M31. I am writing this after almost a month use of Redmi Note 9 Pro Max and Samsung M31.

"Good phone for casual usage","(Review after using it for 2 months) Researched and compared it with Samsung M30s, M31, and Poco X2. (On specs, found this better). (If you do not intend to play games, samsung M series is better). Total money put into this phone till date: Purchase price 16499 plus Kapaver case 599 plus SD card 700. Overall, it is good if the intended usage is casual. The battery life is good, and so is charging time. 33W charging does come in handy. The camera quality is good, attaching a picture for your reference. 64 GB won't be enough so buy SD card along with it. (A 64 MP picture takes up 20 MB). Gaming experience has been above average so far. Crashes exist but are rare. The huge size gives a better experience in streaming videos. However, the same size can become a regular usage issue for people with small hands.","30 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Shravan Belsare","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro Max (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 64GB Storage) - 64MP Quad Camera & Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-557/product-reviews/B077PWJ8RS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great but always with some screen and body issues!","I changed OnePlus 8, 4 times! Due to something or the other defects (like headache giving screens, line marks at the back of the body, etc) as it's expensive! Phone boxes were puffed, torned, some displays were dull if noticed closely, more warm and yellowish. No control by OnePlus on this. People go nuts like ""wow what a display"" not realizing that they are being given inferior quality displays of Samsung. I hope I really hope people strive for perfection to really understand and get what they are paying for by controlling their excitements a bit and forward stronger feedbacks, as I believe I was listened and Amazon India did helped me too. My 5th device came altogether from a different location, excellent box, phone built and display feels more broader even with same dimensions, no two parallel lines design or defect at the back, it's clean and curvy like OnePlus 8 8gb variant (mine is the 6gb one). Screen display is still more warm which I didn't want but colors are very punchy and clearly shows the display is far better than previous returned devices. 1st OnePlus 8 8gb - Had a very long permanent line mark at the back of the body if looked closely. 2nd OnePlus 8 8gb - Display's blue light filter had issues I'm sure as it gave me headache in seconds, eye strain as well. 3rd OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines on edges of the back body if the device was tilted a little, was like a dent kind of design or defect (I believe though this one had the best display even than the 5th one that I'm keeping and more smoother 90 HZ). 4th OnePlus 8 6gb - 2 parallel lines were again there so I thought it's normal and was okay with it, but display was yellowish and dull, playing pubg with graphics optimization made the game look more ugly in extreme hd settings (hdr sucks). Looking at Images on articles, etc were looking just good. 5th OnePlus 8 6gb variant - As told above there are no 2 parallel lines, punchy colors, not dull and very good display, however still yellowish in large part of the screen and whitish around above and right & left edges of the screen in vivid mode (I did noticed in some displays it was not this warm). I also noticed vivid mode was nicer and whiter in previous devices than this one whether they were dull or not. I also know screen being yellowish a bit makes video viewing an amazing experience to make it more natural for skin color, etc. But should be less and corrected with all the flaws mentioned. However, I'm tierd and somewhat satisfied but will want OnePlus to correct if possible with software update without compromising any quality of the display. It's said that Apple never compromises on quality, they even delay their production if they find any imperfections (I don't like iOS or use Apple though).  OnePlus should do like this. Not happy at all with this kind of support. I noticed paying more (when I got the 8gb one) was really like getting better qalutiy made device (the first one, if the issue mentioned wasn't there). This shouldn't be the case as this leads to disappointment and all variants should be given the same attention/perfection with just internal hardware changes. OnePlus 8 will be my first and last device for a short period of time. Will look for a brand who cares. 3 out of 5.","27 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Manpreet Singh","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I played PUBG Mobile and details it provides were so exciting and make it feel real. Shadows of tree,stones, mud, etc. If you have small hands don't buy it for gaming, don't feel comfortable with small hands. Camera is good, can't say it is awesome! Battery life is great too, charge too fast! UI is as expected stock android, some pre-installed third party apps were also installed, you can uninstall all of them except Netflix.

"Better phone but could have been the best","Great phone, Amazon delivers it within 10 hours of ordering really happy there, Pros: Beast performance Great battery Life Brilliant Screen Fluid 90hz And blazing fast oxygen os 5g Cons: Camera: have a 2megapixel camera for the sake of having 3 camera on the back Rest of the camera are only average Hopefully upadates can fix that and given one plus history I think they will! Curved screen cause accidental touches and most covers can't cover phone fully in the front due to display Hence its prone to break more than regular flat screen phone like 7t Have a little bit of weight due to larger battery Princing is highly agressive but could have provided wireless charging and headphone jack In the same price! Overall good phone if you want a future proof phone but this eyes closed But if you are on a budget 7t can mostly get you there with better camera and almost as fast snapdragon 855plus Choose wisely","16 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Sahil bansal","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Do NOT buy this expecting a stellar camera","Obviously, you might have done extensive research, watched many review videos before coming here to make your purchase decision. There is only one way you will be happy with this purchase and that is, if you are looking for a slim, elegant, powerful, light weight device offering a premium in-hand feel. Day to day, if this is what is most important to you, then this is the device to get. Camera is going to serve you well on many occasions (when the lighting is good). People might have told you that the camera system is mediocre. That is not entirely true. There have been few software updates and I can confidently say that yes, the camera is neither great nor is it bad. It delivers decent pictures (when the lighting is good) and if you are not a absolute camera geek, then this will meet and succeed all of your expectations. Incase you are a camera geek, then get the 8Pro and dont think about saving money. Conclusion: Feels expensive and has a nice balance in the hand (Its very light and is a joy to use). The glacial green in matte finish is makes the front of the device look expensive (with the dark edge-to-edge AMOLED panel). It performs like it should. It has an QC 865 after all! It will easily get you through more than a day with a full charge. Its a very low risk decision. Cant go wrong - Just buy the damn thing!","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","SK","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Iconic but Camera could have been even better","I have been using One Plus 8, 6GB RAM, 128 GB version for past two days. I bought this phone at 39,999(2K discount with SBI CC). I was bit skeptcial before i bought this phone as i was planning to buy the PRO version, but i do not regret anymore :) This is my first encounter with luxury segment and believe me it's amazing. Truly iconic experience. It's a master piece in terms of performance. works at lightning speed, face detection is utterly smooth, finger print sensor on the screen works like a charm. Very smooth display(90 hz). You will see a notable difference from 60 Hz phones available out in the market. Built in Alexa capability, ofcourse you have to install the app from Play store. Camera is really good when the object is closer and detail is lost to some extent for distant objects. It could have been better at this price segment, but then no complaints. Final verdict: Just close your eyes and buy it if you are looking for a ultra smooth experience and nice looking smartphone and you may not be fully satisfied if you are looking for a Camera phone matching with Apple standards.","17 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Prasad G.","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"best and most reliable phone at this price","I am writing this review after using this phone for 7 days. I believe real user reviews are more useful than Youtube tech reviews which are highly biased and not practical. I bought the 6 GB variant which is available at 42k. Don't go for 8 GB variant and spend 3k more of your valuable money. For normal users, 6 GB RAM is more than sufficient. 2 GB RAM doesn't make your phone fast, it's the processor that does that work. At 42k price, this is the best option available right now. I would rate it 4.5/5. 1. Design: It is an amazing, premium looking phone. Glass back feels awesome. weight management and dimensions are also great. The curved display looks amazing. 2. Display: Display is bright and visible in direct sunlight. At the lowest brightness level, I did not notice any flickering. In Natural mode, I noticed some yellowish color, it is some software issue or it is like that only. I changed to Advanced>AMOLED wide gamut, now it works perfectly. The curved display doesn't make any difference after 1 or 2 days and it comes with ""fragile tag"" so be prepared to take extra care of it. 90hz really makes the difference over 60hz. Once you use 90hz display, going back to 60Hz would feel like the phone is lagging. 3. Performance: It is a snapdragon 865. Performance is buttery smooth. 4. Software: This is my first oneplus phone. Coming from Motorola phone, my first priority was a stock android experience. OxygenOS is best android UI right, stock android experience with all required customization. Oneplus also provide timely and long term software updates to its phones which is the very good thing. 5. Battery: I was using my phone at 90Hz all the time with all animations on. You would easily get whole day of battery life even if you are moderate to heavy user. For initial 1-2 charging cycles. I was getting around 6 hours of SOT which improved to 7-7.30 hr of SOT. Charging speed is also great, it would charge from 10 to 95% in around 50 mins. 6. Call quality and in other day to day usage, I haven't find any issues yet. Speakers are also very loud and clear. 7. Camera: here comes the one and an only area which I didn't like. Primary camera and ultrawide angle camera is good but not any improvement over 7T. and 2 MP macro camera is really pathetic and useless. I also facing some issue in front camera. Low light photos are blurry and during video calls, it zooms the face and produces blurry face. i hope Oneplus gives software updates and solves all camera problems. I found a solution for myself by downloading Gcam which is giving better results but still for 42k phone, camera is not that good. Conclusion: No phone is perfect. This has issues in camera department. but I believe other than that this phone is great, go for it. When You spend more than 35-40K, always go for brand value like Oneplus, Samsung, Apple. I hope you find this review useful. I Will update if I find any issue in the future.","21 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Vikas Shah","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Camera not upto the mark.","Front camera is really bad with the latest update. It takes blurry photos and night performance is also bad. I am thinking to return it as back camera is also not that good. My realme was doing better job in camera department. Phone is smooth as you can expect from one plus oxygen OS. It seems like one plus launched half cooked phone.","19 Jun 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Himanshu Chaudhary","2.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Amazing Phone!","Some people are comparing Oneplus 8  with Onplus Nord. In case you are confuse and you have the budget please go for this one for following reasons: 1.Oneplus nord has cheap plastic frame. This one has aluminum. Build quality is superb and premium. 2. Nord has 8mp wide angle camera this one has 16mp which rocks 3. Nord doesn't have stereo speakers. The speaker on plus 8 are stereos with dolby support. 4. Nord has UFS 2.1 vs Oneplus has UFS 3.0 5. Nord has ugly dual camera holes in front compared to oneplus 8 having single punch hole 6. The most significant difference is a flagship processor. Nothing can beat snapdragon 865. Nord has mid range processor. This one is a beast 7. Although the resolution and refresh rate is same. Nord has a low quality display while  oneplus has used samsung Amoled panel with eye care certification in oneplus 8. 8. Curved display is premium feature which looks good you don't get that in Nord. It make phone easy to hold as well 9. Oneplus 8 supports usb type C3.0 vs nord has slower type C 2.0 10. Although both Nord and oneplus 8 are not officially waterproof, oneplus 8 is actually some waterproof without certification. 11. Nord is not future proof due to performance this one can last you atleast 3 year Snapdragon 865 is not a joke","02 Aug 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","musa kharbe","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Super snappy 865 5g processor and oxygen os (oh my god! every things feel awesome) 5. Specialy Stereo speker sounds are great, clear and loud. Con: 1. Missing telephoto lens, 100% low light selfi thats look like a 7k mobile camera( i think 7k mobile camera  performance are better than 42k camera mobile) 2.Night video recording with flash light very bad quality.. 3. Nightscape mode need improvement. Note: if you are a hard core camera lover then you avoid that product other then you will go with this performance star , super snappy device.

Given that the S8 was released more than 3 years back, there is no significant advantage of this phone mainly when it comes to software. Or probably it's just my opinion after getting used to the myriad of software tweaks and options that Samsung provided. Yes this has triple camera, but the macro camera is just a waste of space added solely so that One plus can claim they offer a triple camera setup. The camera feels severely limited in the software field. Design is quite good but again it's nothing that I have not experienced before. Speed is awesome with the new Snapdragon processor and 90hz screen refresh rate. Battery Life is okay. It just leaves a lot to be desired on the software front particularly if you are stepping down from an Apple or a Samsung flagship. If you have the budget, then go for the 8 pro.","02 Jul 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","MS","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Back camera had a scratch","I ordered OnePlus 8 (6GB +128GB) variant and recieved it with a slight scratch on the back camera and had to return it. OnePlus shouldn't call their devices flagship unless they aren't able to ensure the 'QUALITY' of the product.

"Honest review after 10 days use","So starting from design and talking about some cons and pros of this beast.The design is very stunning and brilliant than more premium phones,the battery backup is very much of good and as I am a pubg player I use to play 4 hrs continuously without any lag,heating issue & battery drain issue i.e battery backup is pretty worth.Comes to processor it is most speedy device I have ever seen previously I was using on of oneplus flagship device and also tried asus rog 2 but this is much more faster.Lastly comes to camera if u are camera holic don't even think to buy this phone my friend has nokia which worth rs 9k and I found camera quality of that phone is much better in comparison to this device horrible camera quality nightscape pictures look blurry and ultra wide angle is just like zoomout option and selfie looks like cheaper version of vivo another disadvantage is brightness you have to make your brightness full in normal daylight and night mode or reading mode is not that powerful as previous phone.","14 Jul 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Shahidkhan pathan","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Superb, Camera could have been better.","I remember I was one of the early buyers, bought the phone on the first day of sell. Writing the review after using a month, I would say screen quality and battery life are superb. For camera I would give 4/5. Although we don't get wireless charging with it but with 30w warp charger the phone gets charged in no time. SD 865 will not give you a chance to complain about the performance. Premium design,feels smooth, bit slippery if you don't use any cover. The phone comes with 5G, we are not talking about 5G in India now but you never know in a year or so.

"Very good phone","I loved it. Actually this is placed for my brother-in-law and after the delivery, he has complained about the battery which drains very quickly. I suggested him, wait for 2 more days and take a call on it whether a defective piece or not, which needs to be replaced. After 2 days surprisingly the battery is stabilized and works well. The following are best on the phone 1. The screen is very good 2. The PUBG game is very smooth 3.  It catches Networks batter than most of the mobiles. 4.  Camera is good 5. No heating no lagging issues 6. Fast charge is awesome 7. Multi-tasking everything is good Cons 1. I am not happy with the camera at this price, the quality of the camera is almost like my Samsung Galaxy A51 Camera.","07 Aug 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","VRKREDDY","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Flagship at present around 40000/-(6GB|128GB)","1. 6GB /128GB variant is the best value for money. If a bank discount and cashback is available then that shall be an icing on the cake. At a price range of 39000/- to 40000/- this is a best bet as there is no other competition to the one plus 8 in market at present. 2. Asthetic built quality, very nice in hand feel which can be easily noticed while holding the unit in hand. This is a practical size 6.55” screen which can fit in the pockets of trousers or jeans. Light weight (180 gms) and ergonomic design make it user friendly and comfortable to hold. Weight balance is excellent and feels premium in hands. 3. Glacial green colour to me is the best bet. Looks premium, anti-finger print. 4. Curved screen is not that much and i am not facing any accidental touch issues rather the curved screen adds to its premiumness. 5. Camera quality is decent but shall not satisfy camera enthusiasts. One plus needs to push camera updtaes to make front camera more accurate. 6. Latest processor Snapdragon 865 is a breeze to use and lightening fast. Even though it is not 120 Hz there is not much visible difference which can be spotted between 90Hz and 120Hz. Over all screen performance is brilliant. A big thumps up for the beautiful super amoled display. 7. Battery is very good. Last more than a day easily on heavy usage too. Screen on time is around 7 to 7.30 hours in normal use. 7. Best Flagship at present around 40000/-(6GB |128GB). My Ratings : Built quality, weight balance & design : 10/10 ( Brilliant) In hand feel : 10/10 ( Awesome ) Screen quality : 9/10 ( it’s FHD and not QHD so 1 mark less) Battery life : 8.5/10 (Very Good) Performance: 10/10 (Awesome with QSD 865) Camera : 7/10 ( Average ) Call quality : 10/10 (Impressive) Speakers /10/10 (Best in class) Gaming : 10/10 ( awesome) Heating issues : Nothing abnormal Conclusion : Go for the 6/128 GB variant which is best value for money.","05 Jul 2020","Style name: 6GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Sumanta Ghosh","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Glacial Green 6GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-547/product-reviews/B078BNQ318/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Bang For Your Bucks","Well as they say this is indeed the best phone in the price range of ₹25000. If budget permits then go for RealmeX2 Pro for ₹30000 or OnePlus 7T for ₹35000 or more and if it doesn't the go for Realme X2/Redmi K20 for ₹20000. But for the price of ₹25K you are getting: 6.4 inch Horizon Amoled Display (Crisp & Vivid) SD 855 Flagship Processor (Fast & Powerful) 48MP Sony 586 Primary Camera (True Snap) 13MP Ultra Wide Camera ( Truly Wide) 8MP Telephoto with 2X Zoom Accurate In-display finger print sensor Full screen No Noch display 20MP pop-up Selfie snapper 6/128 GB or 8/256 GB storage options What else one needs. Now as far as day to day performance is concerned it's absolutely fantastic. Day camera is brilliant and even night camera with flash takes really stunning photos. Display gives vibrant and punchy colours to enjoy your daily video content and game play. Bottom firing speaker is loud and crisp. Earpiece is sound is cristal clear and loud too. It's also supportsHDR10 and DRM Widevine L1. So just go for it without any doubts if your budget is ₹25K. Also it has no other competitors in that range.","25 Dec 2019","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Indrani Das","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Talking about the device, the screen is emersive and bright, love to watch videos on this device. Cameras are superb. Performence is undoubtedly superb. Battery life is good too, if you don't play PUBG, u will going to get a day life easily or probably more. The phone is bit on the heavier side. I moved from Poco F1 to this one and surely this is heavier than Poco F1.

"Best device under 25000","Display: I just fall in love with this phone's amoled screen.  I use my phone mostly for watching videos on youtube and binge watching on Amazon prime so I'm really happy with this phone's display. Viewing angles and deeper blacks in the display are amazing. If you a movie lover you willl fall in love with this phone. Apart from this the display is buttery smooth and responsive. 60hz display is still good as it consumes less battery. If you haven't used 90hz display is past then you won't gonna miss anything. Performance: It's a beast when it comes to day to day usage. Ram management is great. There's no lag at all. Thanks to the UFS 2.0 storage, the app opening time is very less. The phone boot time is very less and can opened in just few seconds. Gaming performance is great there's no lag at all. You will love playing heavy games Asphalt 9, Call of duty and pubg on it. Phone's has all the sensors in it and picking up all the right spots. Processor is 855 Snapdragon which is the flagship and it won't disappoint you. Battery life: I'm a power user so my phone's battery last for about 6-7 hours which is great. If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone. Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones. OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool. Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me. The network reception in my house is prettty bad and most of the phone's failed in network connectivity but this one is a beast. It has a great network reception and the call quality of the the phone is just outstanding. The wifi speed you get in this device is unmatched and i am just loving it. Audio quality: The audio quality of this phone is great you can listen to Hi Resolution audio songs with ease if you use a earphone that supports high resolution. I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you. I will give it a 10/10 in audio section. So lets look at the overall ratings: Display : 10/10 Battery performance: 10/10 Fast charging: 8/10 Ram management: 10/10 Booting time : 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Network reception: 10/10 Call quality: 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Rear camera: 10/10 Selfie camera: 7/10 Video recording 8.5/10 Audio quality: 10/10 It's a value for money phone and I'm gonna give it a 10/10 in value for money section. I recommend you to go for 128 gb storgage and 6 gb ram variant as it will give you more value for money. The cost of 128 gb/6gb varient is 25000 and in deals you can easily get it at around 24000. Moreover, if you exchange an older cheap handset with this one you can significantly reduce the overall cost. I have exchanged my old device and bought this one for 18148 rs. So just go for it.","02 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Mandeep","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for money Flagship, Just go for it.","Camera performance is okay, Battery is okay. Superfast processor for gamers. Full view display with Pop-up front Cam is what I like.

I have been using it since last 1 month, no problems till now. I got it at Rs. 23000/- with SBI card offer and with 6 months No Cost EMI. At this price its best in the market. Edit 1- Regarding battery performance, it's getting better with updates. Edit 2- After 6 months, I can say it was amazing deal at that time. Now GST has increased from 12% to 18%, so the prices are gone up. I have received MIUI 12 update and user experience just got amazing. It's full view Super Amoled display with Snapdragon 855.

There are few solutions given over internet suggesting changes to APN etc. however that was not required to any other ordinary phones.. and those solutions do not work. Secondly MI is forcing users to use their browser over google chrome ( as they acknowledge the issue but don't care to resolve) which can be security threat.

"Awesome phone at such a cheap price","I only write reviews when I genuinely feel something is worth it. This phone is superb at this price range. **********Pros********** * Processor : Qualcomm SM8150 Snapdragon 855 (7 nm) : Do I need to say anything about this processor. * Battery Capacity 4000mAh : Battery is amazing. It lasts really long with gaming and otherwise. * AMOLED capacitive touchscreen : The screen display is outstanding. * Corning Gorilla Glass 5 : This really protects against any scratches on the phone display but it is always better to buy a screen guard. * FIngerprint sensor: This works like a charm. It is on screen since it is an Amoled display. * Call quality: Loud and clear * Design: Very attractive * Fast charging : Quick Charge 4.0 - It charges the phone really fast, personal experience. The fastest charging title, comparing all the phones goes to Realme X2 Pro I guess (as of now). Cons * No expandable storage : For me 128 GB is more than enough * Pop-up camera for unlocking the phone: For me no issue since I don't use this feature. For many it might be * Camera can be made better: It is good but can be better. Come on, at this price what more do you want. Overall performance: 10/10 Battery life: 10/10 Display: 10/10 Design: 10/10 Camera: 8/10 Software: 8/10 since I like iOS better than any Android version. If you are buying this phone for superb gaming experience and day to day usage then go for it. Also, this phone looks really good and the touch/feel of buttons is nice.","03 Feb 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","Fahad Khan","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great camera, Amazing Builb quality, poor selfie cam","The phone is surely a winner. The camera is the main highlight. It sure is the best camera Redmi has produced . The main primary camera is really nice. The images are vibrant ane has a lot of depth. The Bokeh shots and portrait shots are really nice. The wide angle shots aren't the best though. But the selfie camera is a huge let down. The same crappy redmi camera. The built quality is par excellence, the fit and feel is top notch. The glass body and metal is really nice and we'll built. The display is a bliss to look at. The full display is dream come true. Although the Redmi ui is not the first go to option it grows on you and adding a theme or skin makes it better. The battery backup is good and the quick charging is a saver ! Fingerprint reader is fast as I can tell. The face recognition doesn't get you during dark.","05 Aug 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Adnan Ali","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Does the job","Writing a review after 2 days of usage: Initial feel and look are quite premium, the back is glossy and in hand feel is that of a premium smartphone. Usage and installation is pretty smooth, Snapdragon 855 is bang on the buck, processor is extremely fast, with no lag whatsoever, even after opening 5-6 apps at the same time. Camera quality is pretty average, did not find any pixelation but the color sharpness and contrast are not that great as 1 would expect, selfie camera beautification feature is something i do not like, makes you look overly animated. Battery life is not good, for 4000 mah i expected it to last atleast an entire day without charging, but somehow it disappoints in that area (my usage is very heavy though) 128gb is sufficient initially, but no expandable slot makes me worry that i might have to manage the data i keep on my phone and might have to move some to an external source later down the line. Gameplay is extremely smooth with no lag and touch sensitivity is flawless. Fingerprint reader is pretty efficient and will get it right 9/10 times, might have to delete old prints and re-do them if you install a temper glass. Overall a decent option at this price-range","09 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Charanpreet sehgal","3.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Flagship Mobile with Budget Friendly","I'm orwin from Thrissur, Kerala. I selected k20pro after a deep search in online by reading and viewing reviews. Already my friend bought one with red colour 8GB Variant. He is happy with phone and well satisfied despite the slow pop camera that uses for face recognition. I took 6GB variant with carbon colour. If you want a mobile for day to day use gaming and to take neat photos and crystal clear sound with good display. Go for it. Pros :- *)Mobile is Easy to hold *)Good display *)Better Camera *)Best Gaming *)Awesome Sound *)Good call quality & signal reception *)A class look with front back glass. *)In Heavy Use The phone last one day. ( If charge is 100 in morning ). If the phone is used for continuous screen on and gaming etc. The phone will only last 6-8 hrs. *) Fully charge in 1 hour 20 mts.

"Wish to replace the device, facing issues with performance of the device","I purchased the 6 gb variant and the phone was delivered on 21st March, 2020 and since then I've been facing some issues with the device. First: The device has a really heavy UI that consumes 50% of the Ram... I bought a flagship device for smooth functioning and this device doesn't seem to deliver the same. Second: Almost everyday the screen goes blank while I'm using it and no matter how much I wait it doesn't light back up, I only see the fingerprint blinking and I need to restart it to get back the device to start functioning again. Third: While I'm typing a message or even this review, it suddenly shuts the app and take me to the home screen and then I've to open the app from the recent apps to get back to the work I'm doing.

"A better option is available, ALWAYS!","Xiaomi K20 pro is undoubtedly a good phone. Here are a few of Pros and cons, I could share after around 4 months of usage. Pros: - Camera (IMX586 sensor) - Bright AMOLED panel - SD855 processor - Good Battery life (lasts around 10-12 hrs for me with 100% data on, web browsing, social medias browsing, 1-1.30 hrs of 4G calls) - Last but no least : Head Phone jack and Notification Light Cons : - Higher refresh rate (90, 120, 144 hz) panels available in market with Flagship phones. - Touch sampling refresh rate could have been improved. - Worst UI : ads popping out of nowhere in every app. Xiaomi need to stop selling ads for flagship level phones. If someone spending this much on a phone and still ads are popping of nowhere, this is very irritating. - Upgraded/overclocked version of 855 could have been used instead. Though the phone is good, you get good clicks from Sony's IMX586 (a flagship sensor of its time). Battery life is average. Phones looks average to me. Verdict : Realme X2 pro could have been considered, would have to compromise with camera but HDR and 90 hz panel would be available. Along side, for a good UI OnePlus 7T would always be a good choice, if headphone jack is not a priority. Again, being Indian, this would be my last Chinese owned company's phone/gadget. Have used Samsung's Note 2, S4, S7 Edge, and S8. Now, would again go back for Samsung's phones for better hardware quality and best in class UI.","12 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","Harbhajan Singh","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The true flagship killer.","This was without a doubt the true flagship killer. And even a year after its release, Snapdragon 855 beats all the new generation mid-tier processors by a huge margin. This is quite interesting considering the fact that a lot of your mid-tier phones are now more expensive than the K20 pro. This phone truly has it all - a beautiful AMOLED display, sliding cameras that seem to be pretty well built and sturdy, all the important cameras that you'll actually need at the back (main camera, zoom and ultra wide). The phone looks amazing, feels amazing and works perfectly. If I have to nitpick what I don't like about it, it would be the size (a prefer smaller phones, though this is still smaller than similar phones), the slower fingerprint reader (which wasn't too much of an issue for me at least) and maybe it would be cooler with a 90hz screen (which seems more like a bonus than a necessity).","11 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Areeb","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best in range","Best mobile in 25k range. With dark mode and pixel icon pack the mobile looks super premium, nice haptic feedback,high performance.But front camera performance is just average. Display is awesome. After 3 months Nothing has changed in the performance , camera got even better with updates. BUT , feeling really disappointed because the color coating on the side rim is getting off.

"FLAGSHIP KILLER","Pros : Amoled display is wonderful and giving me great experience I switched from Vivo V5s So I'm really excited and satisfed about this Battery life: Yes battery life is pretty decent for a pubg match in Full HD mode drains about 7-8 percent of battery sometimes 10 Processor: it's a flagship killer and no need to talk about this at all. It's awesome 3.5mm jack Pop up camera is also fast and its light and music sounds cool Notification light on pop up is top-notch Fingerprint: personally I didn't  like in display sensor it's accurate but finger need be placed in some exact position but it's fast Camera and vedio: though it's triple camera still its a big hit camera is awesome no doubt about this Design: it's of pure glass and protected by Gorilla glass 5 design is mind blowing Cons: heating issues,normally phone never raises it's temperature but if you play games after playing you can make dosas on phone graphite cooling they have mentioned but I didn't find it working FAST CHARGING: It's not that fast coz it's just 18W takes 1+ hr to charge completely but k20pro supports 27W if you buy the charger paying 999 it could be even more faster MIUI : sometimes os gets you into trouble you need to click on same tab or screen twice still dosent work but can be solved by software update Price is high and its not con beacuse this  mobile is combination of Snapdragon 855 also comes with amoled display so price will be 25 itself One thing is I brought it after 1 year of its release and still I'm satisfied I got it for 25,499","02 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Vamshi Deekshith","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Costly in today's market","Writing this review after almost 10 days of usage. Let me write the Pros and Cons. PROS: Battery life: Decent battery life. But I compeltely discharged and 100% charged the phone twice after getting it. Since then operating it in the 30-90% range. The 18 watt charger does a decent job in charging it till 90% after which I dont charge it further. Camera: Decent quality camera. Better than my wife's Samsung M30. But dont expect flagship level pics. Its impressive, not excellent. Processor: Snapdragon 855 is a benchmark itself. However I am not a gamer. Still a good processor along with Amoled screen helps to get a better battery life. Display: Very natural display that you expect from an Amoled screen. Better than Samsung M30 again. Style: If looks could kill. 10/10 for the style. Just love it. Os: Had some bloatware. Removed it quickly. Not getting much Ads too. Now the updated MIUI 11 works like a charm. Call quality: Has a decent call quality which is absent in mid range MI phones. Loudspeaker: The mono speaker does a great job too. CONS: 1) Screen response: The screen is not smooth which you expect from a phone in this price range. No 90Hz display too. 2) Finger print sensor: The on screen fingerprint sensor is pathetic. Does not work most of the time. Conclusion: You get what you pay for. Its 10K cheaper than the 1plus 7t. And the quality is compromised according to the price as well. But it has a 855 processor which you wont get in below 20k phones. And the Amoled screen is not wonderful. One plus has a much better display. So you may consider other phones in this range like the newly launched Realme X3 etc.","10 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Suryendu Das","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Over All 5*","What I like is firstly the speed of SD 855. The feel in hand and display is really good. For 🤳 in good light the pictures could match with the best. For rear pictures though the quality is good in poor light I don't know for sure. Also I need to understand it better however I am not to deep into pictures and primarily for work it is amazing the speed and smooth interfacing. Battery life is quite ok too,been using it.for over 3 months Finger print reader works but staggers around and there is just one speaker at the bottom. Also MI pushes a lot of their own stuff like at every opportunity it directs you to MI browser instead of the Google Chrome, beware ofnthat as a lotta unnecessary stuff just latches on to the device.","26 Feb 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Shishir D.","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Just grab it...","Best flagship phone at best price. I got at 19200(12 no cost emi) with exchange of redmi go. Rear camera is beast... potrait mode marvelous. Front pop up camera is average. Amoled Screen is very good,gives you premium feel. Battery performance superb. I'm getting 9-10 hours screen time. Took approx 1.30 hours to full charge, but it supports 27 watt charger which have to purchase seperately. Flagship Processor working very fine, no lags, works very smooth. Network strength very good at my home, internet works very well, but i noticed internet works slow at another location, perhaps this issue will solved soon.","27 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","jatin mohan sain","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Flame Red 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Flame-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN5WR4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"It's OnePlus Victory!","First of All, OnePlus phones are now Made In India totally from the OnePlus 8 series. Even Apple phones are Made in China, but not OnePlus Now. Now coming to the Phone, The OnePlus 8 sets the bar high for affordable flagships in 2020. While its design refinements borrow elements from other flagships, it's an undeniably sleek phone, with waterfall display edges and a punch-hole for the front-facing camera. With a Snapdragon 865 and up to 12GB of RAM, the phone is high-performance despite costing notably less than most flagships, making it the cheapest ""5G"" phone in many markets. As for how the OnePlus 8 measures up to devices beyond those made by OnePlus itself, there's a compelling case to be made for this flagship phone. The OnePlus 8 performs as well as any leading Android device and even makes the iPhone 11 sweat a little. You'll get very good battery life — at least when the phone's faster refresh rate isn't taxing the battery. The display itself is the same size as the OnePlus 7T's, measuring 6.55 inches. It's an AMOLED panel, with a full-HD+ resolution, HDR10+ compatibility, and a refresh rate of 90Hz. OnePlus also brags about the panel's high colour accuracy. From what i have seen so far, the display is definitely bright, with good sunlight legibility and punchy colours. You also get lots of options in the Settings app to tweak the colours to your liking. For a phone with such a big screen, the OnePlus 8 doesn't take up that much space, at least when it comes to width. At 6.3 x 2.9 x 0.31 inches, OnePlus' phone is taller than the iPhone 11 (5.94 x 2.98 x 0.33 inches) and Galaxy S20 (5.9 x 3 x 0.31 inches), though not as wide. With 8mm of thickness, the OnePlus 8 is also fractionally thinner than Apple's iPhone 11, so you'll have minimal trouble slipping the OnePlus device into a pocket. At 6.3 ounces, it's lighter than the iPhone 11, too, though not as light as the 5.7-ounce S20. The OnePlus 8 comes with a 4,300-mAh battery — bigger than the 3,800-mAh power pack in the OnePlus 7T though not as large as the 4,510 mAh battery you'll get by paying up for the OnePlus 8 Pro. That shouldn't matter too much, as the OnePlus 8 delivers superlative battery life. A bigger tradeoff that OnePlus 8 owners have to make, at least compared to the OnePlus 8 Pro, concerns the cameras. While the Pro model features four lenses, the OnePlus 8 sports only three — and one of those isn’t a telephoto lens. Instead, the 48-megapixel main shooter with its f/175 aperture and 16MP ultra wide camera are joined by a 2MP macro lens. That's great, in theory, for taking detailed objects, but if you want to zoom in, you're at the mercy of a digital zoom that can add noise to your shots. But yes, its getting betterand better with every other updates OnePlud is launching like every week. Overall, would i recommend this phone? Obviously Yes, its a steal deal for the price! Plus you get the best android experience! (I would say even better than iOS)","04 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Mridul Deepanshu","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Don't buy","Only good thing it has is oxygen os ,so much for brand 3rd camera is useless bcz company rolled back its features so basically it is 2 camera phone on back Believe it or not it touch features r on bitter side and u should go with any other phones such as realme x50 pro with more features on every field but oxygen os then this one plus overall 3.5stars I felt like one or 2 times it hangs a little bit but it maybe due to its touch issues even after update which says that touch issues have been solved overall it's price should be around 38k but don't know which features helped to be 45k  u would say 90heartz refresh rate but realme provide this all features +65w dart charger plus 4k less and made in india.","08 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Indra Sagar","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best than any other premium smartphones","I upgraded from OnePlus 5 to OnePlus 8 and the upgrade is worth. Display, fingerprint scanner, audio, in-hand feel everything is just mind boggling. I don't know why people are commenting that camera is not good. What they want in a 45k smart phone? A sony Alpha mark3? Believe me camera is superb.

"Mango person review","I am a fan of one plus series and have been using one plus 5t since a long time When I received this product, my hopes were really high! But when I started using this phone I feel a bit dissappointed.. -The finger touch unlock isn't very fast, one plus 5 t was way better in this case - Camera expectations are not fulfilled, pics have a bit animated quality - Notification light isn't present like it was in one plus 5t. The light blinks only when you get a notification and that too it's so light that you would barely notice. - 1 little bug > front cam settings to set the aspect ratio isn't differentiating between 4:3 and 'full' size - A little lag was observed when clicking a selfie Sadly, I think paying 45k for this phone isn't worth","11 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Tanvi nigam","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Ghost Touch Issue","I was loyal samsung phone user thought to try hands on Oneplus series, bought Oneplus 8. I am highly disappointed with the Ghost touch issues. While chatting on Whatsapp or other messaging app it get exit to home screen automatically. Also quality of battery is very poor, it will get discharged in 6hours of normal use.

The phone doesn't skip a beat when playing graphic intense games like pubg. The oxygen OS is as smooth as ever. Better than any android skin in the market.

"Not value for money anymore","Coming from samsung S series I can compare if this phone should be called flagship, or this is so called flagship Pros: I like the overall design. Front design comes from Samsung edge models. Battery backup is good with SOT of approx 7 hours in a day. Color reproduction is fine. Don't compare it with Samsung's display. Cons: Camera: rear is still fine, could have been better, however front camera sucks. The picture quality and colour reproduction is average. Charging: phone heats up to a level sometimes where you can't hold it. The camera bump and linear set up looks odd. 2 megapixel camera ? Shouldn't be there. More than useless Software: though I like the idea of stock Android, the gboard isn't that great like Samsung, and few tools like select and share are missing. Cost cutting on wire size. It's not even 1 mtr No memory card or Hybrid slot. For this price no earphones? Not even converter? Online reviews are only paid while the compare S20 with OnePlus 8. This doesn't have IP rating or 2K screen and no earphones. Don't let them fool you. It's not reasonable anymore.","20 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","SK","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Good phone but not worth the price","The OnePlus 8 uses the Snapdragon 865 SoC and supports 5G Battery life, gaming performance, and the display are its strong suits It doesn’t get an IP rating or wireless charging like the Pro model OnePlus 8 Design: Subtle, yet distinctive I wasn't a big fan of the circular camera bump on the OnePlus 7T and I'm glad that's gone away. However, I do miss the frosted finish of the glass back. The Onyx Black version of the OnePlus 8 has a glossy finish, which picks up fingerprints very easily. It's also very slippery, which did result in accidental drops when I had the phone lying on a chair's armrest. There's a case provided in the box, which should help. The display now has a hole-punch cutout, in the upper left corner. OnePlus has said goodbye to the notch and I think it's for the best. The hole-puch isn't the smallest I've seen but it gives the OnePlus 8 a fresh look. As I mentioned in my first impressions, the OnePlus 8 is surprisingly comfortable to hold given its display size. It's also slim and not too heavy. The black version looks fine, but I was really looking forward to seeing the Interstellar Glow trim first-hand, as I feel that that's the colour to get. As you'd expect, build quality is excellent thanks to the curved-edge front and back glass sandwiching the metal frame. The buttons are easy to reach, and the alert slider is handy as always. The USB Type-C port, SIM tray, and main speaker are lined up on the bottom. Overall, the new simplified design is welcome, and I like that OnePlus isn't trying too hard to impress. This phone might look a bit boring in the pictures, but it's instantly recognisable as a OnePlus device. The OnePlus 8 has a simple, yet distinctive design OnePlus 8 Display: Bright and vivid The display is one of the most important parts of any smartphone, and the OnePlus 8 has a very good one. It's a 6.55-inch AMOLED panel with sloping sides, a wide colour gamut, and a hole-punch cutout in the upper left corner. OnePlus has used 3D Corning Gorilla Glass in addition to the pre-applied screen protector. I found the latter to be more of an annoyance than anything since my finger grazed against the edges when swiping in from the sides. Other specifications include a resolution of 2400x1080 (full-HD+) pixels, HDR10+ support, a 90Hz refresh rate, and software features like reading mode, night mode, and the ability to boost colours when playing videos. The 90Hz refresh rate makes usage in general feel fluid and snappy. You can drop down to 60Hz if you want to save a bit of battery power. HDR content looks very good on the OnePlus 8. When playing compatible shows through Netflix, the brightness and colour saturation automatically get a boost. This goes back to normal once you exit the app. The OnePlus 8 has an in-display fingerprint sensor, which is super quick at authentication. All it takes is a quick, firm tap to unlock it. Face recognition is equally fast and works decently well in dim lighting. You can enable the ‘double-tap to wake' gesture, but what I really wanted was a raise-to-wake gesture, which is still not an option. The 'Ambient display' feature offers a peek at which apps have sent you alerts when the screen is off, along with the time, battery level, etc. However this isn't always-on and only shows up when you tap the screen or pick up the phone. It even shows you the name of the music track being played, but you can't control playback from here. One thing to note is that since the hole-punch cutout isn't very close to the top edge, any app that needs to black out this area will have to create a thick black bar. This is most noticeable in some games and video apps, when you need to hold the phone horizontally. You can also black out the area permanently but that just looks odd. The display is one of the best features of the OnePlus 8 OnePlus 8 Performance: Keeping it cool With its top-end hardware, it's hardly surprising that performance from the OnePlus 8 is impressive. However, what really caught our attention is that it doesn't heat up all that much in the process. That's not something we could say for the Mi 10 5G (Review), for example. The OnePlus 8 aces through benchmarks too. In AnTuTu, we got 5,78,289 points, while GFXbench's Car Chase graphics test returned 46fps, which is one of the tougher scenes in the suite. The sides and a few spots on the back, below the camera, do get warm after non-stop benchmarking, but never too hot. This speaks a lot about the thermal management design of the phone.","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Ryanrazor1911","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"You will not regret. MOSTLY!","Fingerprint reader takes considerable amount of time to recognise my finger and it even failed to do so in certain cases. Face recognition is amazing, superbly fast. Oneplus did not do well with the battery life at at at all.. it drains as far as it charges and is pretty disappointing tbh. Camera will keep you coming back for more. Kudos to that. Butter smooth operation and certainly speed. The case that comes in the box is not the best one, you can opt for a sandstone one from oneplus which are pretty good as well. Device doesn't heat up easy and looks classy in my hands. Very sleek and premium feel definitely worth every penny! Tions of customisation features available. Please be careful and don't mistake the mic aperture for sim tray ejection.. so take care about that coz they lie pretty close to each other on the bottom corner of the phone. Sweaty hands donot smudge the screen which is probably a great blessing for people belonging to humid coastal areas like me!! Overall id say oneplus could have done better but the bench is still set pretty high!!!!","25 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Deekshya","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best Flagship For The Money","Pros: -Screen is beautiful, a slightly bigger resolution from the previous generation of phones. Do I really need to say the 120Hz is absolutely stunning?! -Speakers are LOUD, honestly did not expect the level they produce, they are by no means audiophile but they do a good job. -Responsiveness to touch is next level, I've used Apple's and Samsung's flagships, and I really enjoy the smoothness of transitions between applications, faster than the competitors I have tried. -Oxygen OS is by far one of my favorites of the phone, it's lightweight and not bogged down by anything. -Games run very smooth! -Battery life is pretty amazing, 4500mah last a LONG time Cons -Some people may be turned off that by default Netflix comes installed on the phone(Though the HDR on it is AMAZING LOOKING) -Transitioning from an Apple or Samsung may leave some software features to desire, possibly UI issues you do not like. However there is a great deal of customization with this phone so it has never been an issue with me. ALEXA -Alexa DOES NOT COME INSTALLED BY DEFAULT, PLEASE STOP DOWN VOTING FOR A PHONE YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE. -That being said if you want alexa, it's in the app store, if not you're set! Conclusion -This phone was controversial in a that it was a flagship, from a company that has historically against flagships. However, it is an absolutely superb piece of technology that is well worth the money.","05 Aug 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Gurinder27","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Disappointment","I am not sure whether its defective device I received or its manufacturing faults. 1. Devise starts heating up even after only continuous texting of just 30 min. 2. Poor battery back-up. If you have moderate to high usage of phone [excluding use of game/ high graphics app] battery needs to charge two time a day. 3. Charger takes around 1.5 hours to get it charge from 15% to 100%. No fast charging. 4. Adding to that its Camara quality. few features can only work with 12 MP option so whats the meaning of having 46 MP camara. This time One Plus has put expectation down with its 8 series.

"Bit Overpowered overpriced phone but a great phone","1)Phone is quite slippery, can't use without a case. 2)Display issue i.e black bar near camera punch and finger print reader is in almost every set but not visible in 99pct of regular usage 3) with OnePlus releasing z within a 1 month of launch of OnePlus 8 makes one wonder why not launch all three together and will make OnePlus8 not a logical choice for many. 4) camera is avg. Not upto par with a budget flagship camera of let alone of samsung s10lite. 5) battery is avg 7-8 hrs of sot but 0 gaming and just Netflix and social media. So it is not something huge or ground breaking.single charge can get you thru the day of moderate usage and might need to charge for 30-40 min more before you can use it for late night binge watching. 6) watching Netflix or any video is a breath taking experience combined with a dolby Atmos stereo speakers. No complaints and quite impressed here.","29 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","ashish bansal","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"First Hand Review after 1 Month Usage","It is smooth as every oneplus. Battery back up is fantastic. You can use phone for more than 2 days on normal usage. Haven't got much opportunity for testing camera outdoors due to covid. The only two issues iam noticing are with network and camera. Phone stops making calls and other side dialer receives switch off message when they dial. But data keeps working. When you attach videos in whatsapp, the video's playback is blurry.

"Good phone but with little high price","I got the phone after 4 days as I stay in a remote area (Obviously because of Corona). The first thing to notice after I unpack is slim and nice mobile and the package was so nice. Regarding the details atleast from the first experience as I generally use iPhone is superb. Camera quality is top-notched with all the features. Don't believe in others says that camera quality is not good.... but rather, it is really really good. Depth recognization for portrait is ok but not at par with iphones Coming to the battery life, it is good as this mobile super display so considering the size and quality of display, battery life is good Display and accessibility:  accessing applications are super easy and display is simply owesome (yay... oneplus) But since it is lack of wireless feature and only have this feature for oneplus 8pro, for oneplus 8 I feel it is bit expensive Overall, good mobile, go for it, you would love it.","18 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Kranthi baddepuri","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Buy it for fast processing, Not for camera","I am posting this review after using one plus 8 for more than 2 weeks. One plus 8 satisfies it's standards in terms of processing. It is really fast. Display quality and Dolby Atmos are brilliant. But I am highly disappointed with camera quality. I would say if camera is your first priority then try other options in market, not one plus 8. One plus is only attracting the customer with the big number like 48mp or 3/4 cameras.  When it comes to the saturation, contrast and focus, the camera really struggles a lot.","15 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Deepak yadav","4.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The one phone for you...","* Stunning display. You can understand only when you use it. I don't have any touch issues with the curved display. * Very bright display. I mostly use it at 20 - 25 % brightness indoors. OnePlus 8 Pro is even brighter when I compared both side by side. But this one is more than enough. Even in the brightest sun the display outshines. * Very Premium feel and very comfortable in hand despite being a huge display ( I like smaller displays over bigger ones). This one doesn't feel bad in hand though. Weight balancing is very well done. Being a big display one hand operation is not easy. * Blazing speed. * Phone gets little warm when playing graphical intensive games. As I use a case I don't directly feel the heat or warmth * Surprisingly louder speakers * Decent camera (I'm not a power user of camera) * Cleaner oxygen OS * Decent battery life with 90Hz * 90 Hz spoiled me. Now feeling that my iPad Air is straining my eyes. * Once paired with OnePlus bullet wireless z is a very good experience for calls and music (I'm not missing the 3.5mm music jack) * Warp charging is very good both for Phone and for bullet wireless z ear phones * Punch hole does not distract the full screen experience that much (I was worried before purchasing) Initially I waited to buy OnePlus 8 Pro. But couldn't get in the sale. Hence settled for OnePlus 8. But not a bad choice I would say. This is more than enough for my usage.","10 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"an ok phone  missing many things -- a detailed review","i am writing this review after 3 days of usage: disclaimer :i am not a pro gamer or someone who goes behind excellent cameras Issues:  1) pathetic camera.. - even after being someone who doesnt care much about camera, i felt that the budget phones will have better ones.. the only good thing is ultrawide cam.  and the selfie cam sucks in low light 2) display-- overall its good, but i got a defective one.  which had green tint and red tints in low light 3) Alexa lacks something-- not impressed 4) horizontal light is hardly visible in good light conditions 5) fingerprint sensor light is very bright in low light conditions- something which is hardly tolerable 6) feel like there is issues with focusing in the camera especially for macro cam( i had a samsung phone taken 5years back- still i feel that it is better in terms of focusing and front cam) 7) PRICE--  personally feel that it is only worth 35k-40k pros--  many are there.. will be listing some 1) Speaker-- Its just amazing with the dolby atmos and the 2 speakers 2) Oxygen OS --except some bugs..  overall this provides an amazing experience 3) Battery -- good battery backup.. got 34hours of backup, with the screentime being 8hours and all background apps running 4)  design -  a premium feel  especially the onyx black colour looks exceptional 5)  display full hd --  even though it lacks qhd or higher resolutions, the difference is hardly visible overall it will be a perfect selection, if the price is within 35-40k  , otherwise i dont feel this as a good choice","09 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","shys","3.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"TRUE FLAGSHIP KILLER🔥🤟","Spec monster with friendly user interface and an awesome camera quality for the price.Its veryyyy pleasing to use this device.Trust me anyone can't complain anything on this device, once after using it in hand.Feels absolutely like a flagship.If you are coming from those crappy under 20k devices with their bloatware filled cluttery softwares,then this One Plus 8 will definitely amaze you. Ergonomics of this device are done right.It feels light in hand and that sturdy aluminium and Glass Sandwich build is definitely 🔥.The curved edge isn't annoying and is adds to the beauty of this device.If you don't zoom in a lot,then this camera is amazing and zoom is definitely usable until 5X.Macro shots can be replaced with Digital zoom in my opinion while the main and ultrawide cameras do great.Charging is damn good and we need not even worry of the battery life in a daily usage.Rest is a snappy experience in a beautiful dark mode interface.Don't think too much to buy it.This is definitely a future proof device which for sure is an extremely amazing Flagship killer phone.Give it a GO!😄🤘💥","19 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","G hemanthkiran","5.0","OnePlus 8 (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-237/product-reviews/B071Z97T2C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Excellent device for day to day tasks and balanced one with Android 10","Battery life Too good . Screen quality excellent and perfect touch . Can open multiple apps that we use in daily life and ram management is excellent. In hand feel premium and balanced even though it has high battery. Rear camera after update works perfectly in day light for indoor photos must use flash and belive me it has too strong quad flash that makes photos great in indoor. For gaming high graphics games like pubg it is not suitable . Overall Too beautiful look with battery and dot in display type make the phone value for money .

"Misleading EMI option on Amazon","The product is fine and working well. Battery and camera quality is phenomenal and met the expectations.  Unfortunately the Amazon promise on zero cost EMI is misleading. I opted for 6 months EMI considering zero percent interest. But HDFC bank charged me around 12% interest plus GST etc. This is like taking customer for a ride.  I was surprised to receive a msg like that from bank. Just to alert Amazon to rectify this immediately.","28 Aug 2019","Size name: 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage Style name: with No Cost EMI / Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Aqua Blue","","Yes","Amazon Customer","5.0","Vivo Y12 (Aqua Blue, 3GB RAM, 64GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Vivo-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B07PSHDTHB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I went to mobile cafe and asked them for good camera phone in 10k. They gave me 4 options.  Using test phones in shop I clikc2d same photo and found this model better.

"A great feature rich phone but has Display issues.","I bought this 12GB+256GB Glacial Green variant and physically it looks stunning. The design is top-notch. The punch hole camera does not spoil the overall screen experience as some people have said. Very sleek and premium looking design-wise. The battery life does not last really long when you use it on 120 Hz QHD+, although it's quite manageable and can get through the day with mid usage easily. Coming to gaming, I'm a hardcore gamer and can game continuously for 3-4 hours, and let me tell you this phone can run through it with ease. I've played PUBG quite a lot on this device and have not noticed any major frame drops at HDR graphics and Extreme frame rates, let alone Smooth graphics. It runs PUBG really smoothly. Stable frames at all times. I would suggest it for competitive PUBG and other games too. The 120 Hz Amoled screen is breathtaking. Buttery smooth at all times. Certainly the best display on a phone. I have found the cameras to be decent enough. Nothing too fancy, nor a let down. Videos are very stable though. This has come close to the iPhone cameras as a video shooter. This might even offer better stabilization than the iPhone videos. The colour filter camera is disabled out of the box. Speakers are fairly loud and clear. A very good surround experience. You'll find a Dolby sample video in your gallery. Play it on the phone speakers and see for yourself. Here comes the bad part about it. The phone that I had received, I used it for about 2 weeks and discovered it had this image retention issue. The afterimage of anything displayed for a period of time on the phone for a long time is displayed on the screen even after the original image is pulled off. This could be seen while watching Youtube videos in non-fill screen mode or videos that have any kind of frame visible or even games like PUBG where static elements of game like the map's frame or your controls would be visible on certain background colours even after you have turned the game off. I had reset the phone and not seen any kind of improvement. I checked on the community and many people have experienced this issue as well. The hole-punch band issue is there but it was very vague and DC dimming could fix it. Also, my screen had no green tints. The image retention issue could easily turn into permanent screen burns really soon. So, I have returned my product for now and plan to buy the same phone again. Hope you people find this review useful. Not a very organized review but that's what I have experienced.","01 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Arindam Singh","3.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Dont buy it.Display is not upto the mark","I bought the phone during the first sale on 15June.I was very excited for the phone due to all the hype on the social media and what not.It was amazing at first,blazing fast speed,120hz refresh rate and the display was gorgeous to look at,but after around 9th day,my display was having issues and after 11 days,half the screen would show a weird purple tint while watching youtube in dark mode and using chrome and apps with similar black color.My whole experience was ruined,so much that i sold the phone at ₹3000 loss.I'm 99% sure,no matter where you buy the phone,it would have some display issues in one way or another which is very disappointing.I urge you to stay away from this phone as the screen is not calibrated like it should've been.Totally not worth your hard earned money.","02 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Aman Singh","1.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Having display issues","When i was testing my device for any display issues i kind of felt white colors are a bit too warm which looked like it had some tint effect to it in my unit, so i went into display settings and changed the calibration to advanced and selected AMOLED wide gamut with a cool color tone. it seemed to be good and then after a while, i started noticing image retention issue which was visible in light gray background. so i tested it keeping full brightness and opening chrome incognito mode and i could see home screen icons visible there (as shown in picture). i called in for replacement but unfortunately, i can only get a refund due to low stock of op8pro disappointed a lot in the quality of oneplus devices for which we pay 60k.","29 Jun 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Dhanush KT","1.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Review after using Oneplus 8 pro for two weeks","I am using the phone for almost two weeks now. Here is my review: Pros: 1. The screen is exceptionally great with 10-bit color display. I didn't face any issue in low brightness though I have updated the OS as soon as I received. 2. The camera is decent and the speaker quality is excellent. 3. Thanks to Oxygen OS, there's almost no bloatware and NO Ads at all. The gaming mode feature is superb if you're into gaming. 4. Touch and Feel are just awesome and the curved display is beautiful. 5. The overall experience is extremely smooth thanks to 120 HZ display. 6. I have played COD Acton Mobile for hours and it doesn't have any heating issue. 7. The wireless charging is super fast with the Oneplus Wireless Charger(30 W) and the phone didn't get heated after charging. The battery backup is also decent. Also, the OnePlus charger provided in the box supports WARP charging(30W). 8. The performance is just awesome thanks to SnapDragon 865, UFS3.1, and LPDDR5 RAM. Cons: 1. Color Filter Camera is disabled as of now. 2. No USB C to 3.5 mm adapter is provided in the box.","04 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Soham Ghosal","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"OnePlus 8 Pro the best phone in the market right now","I have brought One plus 8 pro (12GB) since 1 day. No display issues, checked everything. Some apps like Netflix are not supported with full display view which may are improved in future. You tube is supported and looks amazing. sound is very loud and clear from speakers. Battery life is amazing, especially when you are not using phone, it hardly loses battery. First impression is this is the best display I have ever used till date.... The OnePlus 8 Pro finally achieves the goal of being a high-end smartphone, with fewer compromises than ever before. It brings a very polished design, an amazing display with internals to make them shine. The cameras are also vastly better than its predecessor. No other smartphone at this price offers the same experience on so many fronts. + Points Class-leading display Smooth and consistent performance Exquisite built Enjoyable set of cameras IP rating (kinda) AGAINST Most expensive OnePlus yet","22 Jun 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Ravi Vaghera","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"DONT BUY FOR NOW","Hi let me start my story. My bro bought one plus 7 pro at the time when it launched. From then I decided my next phone will be one plus so I waited for 8 pro. Ive been waiting from April to get this phone in my hand. After several attempts in flash sale finally got to hold this mobile last Tuesday. After receiving it and using for the past 3 days I was so disappointed and all the wait went in vain. This phone seems to have some serious display issues. And all those reviewers doesn't seem to mention them maybe they are provided with the best manufactured versions. This phone has banding issues and colour shift issues for sure. I could see that hole punch camera band when brightness reduced below 25% and on grey backgrounds while gradually decreasing and increasing I could see some disco sort of colour shift in it. The phone's screen flickers couple of times in a day. The screen also flashes constantly. The notification screen produces some negative kind of profile pics I'll attach the same. The phone freezes often, this is some issue OnePlus is facing for the first time. In applications such as chrome, whatsapp and even games the phone freezes and to fix it I have to lock and unlock the screen everytime. Issues while HDR content. When reduced to its Lowest brightness in prime HDR contents it gets covered up with a grey layer and that looks awful. These are issues I went through in just 3 days and to add none of these issues are with 7 pro. It's because of the OLED screen people are facing these issues. All these might be small issues but it can't be compromised for 60k mobile. Ive initiated a return and refund since OnePlus has stopped the sale of 8 pro owing to all these issues I guess","10 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","gowtham","3.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"This is not a Flagship","Please spare your self pain to buy an experiment and buy another phone. Though on paper OP8 Pro is an excellent device, in reality, it has multiple display issues that CAN NOT be rectified by software updates and inferior camera quality.

"The best Android Phone but with flaws","This phone is a beast, at 60k you get true value for your money. Software, camera, performance  everything is perfect. Unfortunately my phone had display issues, first the black bar that runs along the hole punch camera, I initially didn't noticed it but when I changed the wallpaper it was visible. At both 120Hz and 60Hz black bar was persistent. Second Image Burning, after just 2 days of using it, the battery and network icons on top were burned on my screen, permanently. Even the home screen icons at the bottom were burned on my screen. The manufacturing date of my phone was 6/20. Following these issues I returned my device, and due to these same issues this device is hard to recommend. Quality Control was not satisfactory with OP 8pro.","16 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Danish Behnal","4.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Oneplus 8 pro","I have been using this device since last 1 month. Sharing my views about the device Pros 1) Display - It's pretty good. (120 Hz + QHD/FHD is treat to use) 2) Oxygen OS - One of the best Android skin. No bloat, lag-free. Clean OS 3) For the first time, I have seen such a good set of speakers in an Oneplus Phone. Same stands for cameras. 4) Battery - Phone could easily last for 1 day. If we increase the resolution of the screen then battery life would be impacted. Still battery life is amazing. 5) Vibration Motor/  Haptic Feedback has improved a lot compared to previous generation Oneplus devices. Cons: 1) Phone gets heated quite easily. 30-45 mins of PUBG or COD in high graphics setting is enough to burn your palm :P. 2) Display Issue - Display issue does exist in my phone i.e. Punch hole Banding. It's faint & only visible in a dark environment and grey background. Green tint and Black Crush issue don't exist on my unit. If you can ignore these cons then this device is one of the best Android Device out there.","13 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Ronit Acharya","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The best flagship in the market.... Period","Review afer 15 days of usage... This phone, has outperformed every other competitor that not only are of same specs but costlier than this phone. Be it the Samsung S20+ or the S20 Ultra, display is top notch and upto the mark. Its not only similar to Samsung's but even better in some aspects. Blacks are too deep with natural colors in almost all scenarios. Everything about this phone is just Flagship, be it the Awesome display, OS, MEMC Graphics smoothening, sound quality, haptics or the physical feel... Few cons that can be easily resolved by updates: Battery backup is above average, not the best but almost lasts full day.. Front Camera quality needs to be improved thoroughly.. Color Filter camera needs to be enabled asap, customers have paid for this advertised feature by Oneplus. Go Blindly if your budget is around 55k, you won't regret the purchase...","01 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","R.

"GREAT DEVICE WITH SMALL ISSUES 😀","One plus has really done it this time by launching an perfect flagship phone, been using it since July 3 and I find it very addictive although if ur reading my rewiew then I'll mention some issues I faced with the 12/256 version at the end, After the purchase I directly went ahead and did an Unboxing of the device and my eyes popped into this glacial beast and the accessories are pretty unique compared to other phones,after which I set up the phone, got an oneplus oxygen os10.5.10 undate went ahead downloading and installing it,I then drained the phone completely to 1% nd charged it took me 1hr5 mins fr full charge and 29 mins for 50% of it which I found very satisfying, please go ahead and buy a case and tempered glass ASAP after getting the device into ur hands the screen was amazing with 120hz refresh rate nd QHD , although (1) I did find the Black bar on an selective gray backgrounds in an dark room on the lowest brightness settings its mainly an hardware thing cause of the laser engraving of punch holed 📷 on the screen I found no other issues like green tint, slight Black crush on shanok map in pubg Olly on an dark room with low brightness. The 🔋 battery is amazing in this beast I used it on pubg on HDR+EXTREME settings for an whooping 3.5-4hrs and still had 18% left which is amazing, the fanatic mode gives u an addictive gaming experience in this device (2) but I did find some heating issues near the camera not soo much at the battery surprisingly. The Dolby speaker is the best on oneplus. The camera almost could pull off as an SLR with its capabilities. I THRILLED WITH THE DEVICE AND FOUND THESE PETTY SCREEN/OTHER ISSUES NULLED BY THE OTHER FEATURES,SO IAM GOING TO CONTINUE USING THE DEVICE AND HOPE GOT THE BEST. Note: this is just my opinion at the end of the day ur spending 60k on it so u are entitled on your decisions. 🥶🥶TAKE CARE~NEVER SETTLE 🥶🥶🤟","06 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","sriharsha","4.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Flagship indeed","There had been a lot of reviews and issues that had cropped up in the phone leading up to its launch. After having used the phone for a while it is clear that these issues have been sorted out. Some pros and cons Pros 1. Display issues have definitely been sorted out, especially the scary ones that were reported earlier. It is an absolute treat to watch Netflix and play games on it. 2. The camera is finally worth the money paid. Crisp and sharp images. 3. Overall experience of the phone is amazing. Motion smoothening is something I will have to get accustomed to, but it is definitely a plus. 4. Battery life is great and I can easily get 7+ hours of screen time while navigating between multiple apps and with the data switched on. I keep the refresh rate at 60 Hz, since that is sufficient for normal social media applications. 5. Glacial green has been shown rather poorly in the advertisements. It is rarely green in colour, more often switching between a beautiful blue or teal colour. Cons 1. The waterfall display has caused touch issues at times, but that is because of the way I hold my phone (with the fleshy part of my palm pressed against the sides) I will come across more cons as I keep using the phone but for now I genuinely have not faced any issue whatsoever, it has been a wonderful experience using it. Definitely something that you can purchase and then forget about for 4-5 years given the quality of the hardware.","29 Jun 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Hrishyank S.","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best but Not Better","Well, It's been a month now using now. Battery life is good. Camera is good but after recording a video and seeing it in mobile is awesome but when you sent video to any other devices then you will find that videos don't play Properly. Sometimes mobile get's hot, I mean very hot. Sometimes mobile doesn't function properly and it hangs a lot. And you might experience problems while calls connected from 2nd SIM. Network issue you may notice. But, Mobile is good and other features are good which you might not see innany other mobile.","30 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Vijay M.","4.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Display Issue?","I was only concerned about the display issue that has been reported by several users. Thankfully I could not find that in my phone even after trying to reduce the brightness to minimum, turning on DC dimming, night mode etc. However the lowest birghtess that it offers is not as low as other phones and watching video in a dark room at night is not a very pleasing experience.. No other complaints..

Common issues black bar, black crush, green tint, brightness flickering, image retention of previous page. Can explore more on google.

"Great device overall but has some issues in the display","Build quality: the phone is very solidly built. Feels very premium in the hand. The frosted glass back feels very smooth to the touch as well. There were some issues though which will be mentioned towards the end. Camera: the camera is quite good. Colours seem off at times but overall a good camera and gets the job done most of the time. Battery life: the battery life on this phone was above average. Experienced some battery drain while the phone was idle but during use, the battery lasted quite long. Gaming: I played PUBG mobile and initial impressions were that the phone is rather big. Long gaming sessions may not be very comfortable on this device. But I gamed on this device for only 2 days so I guess one can get used to the size of the phone and then it shouldn't be a problem. Performance: the overall performance was great! The UI is buttery smooth and runs really well. Issues: display issues. A black bar which was mildly visible to the right of the front camera. But that wasn't as visible as the other major issue on the unit I recieved. The middle section of the display had dark patches, sort of like a black crush especially when viewing a grey screen of the UI on YouTube. As this was visible every time I opened YouTube and since I use YouTube quite a lot throughout my day, this was a deal breaker for me. Hence I returned my device. Please note, not every unit is affected by this issue. It's just that my unit had it.","10 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Rohan Shenoy Nagar","3.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Bought 2 Phones- Black and Green,So reviewing about both colors","Black - Classic,Looks rich in hand,and also looks more classy,only drawback is the fingerprint on the back are more visible as compared to the green.if you are going for black cover unto 1000 rupees than it looks a classic piece and even above more enriching experience. Green: Looks more enriching and therefore more bright in hand,but doesn't go well with the whole looks of the phone.Specially the black color and screen on the side (the light for (notification) looks extremely pleasant on the black one and on green its slightly off.The green color problem is u will not find any same matching color and some parts are always visible that gives it a different looks in comparison to the phone. So slight classiness gets reduced. Green if you are going to use it without cover or transparent cover.Black goes well with the covers but not without cover.Black have very bad back that soak fingerprints like sponge. So choice is yours. All photos are available online , i will add in due time the photos. Writing this review at night around 12,so cant post photos now.","18 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","CHANDAN GULERIA","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Upgrade from OP 5T to OP 8Pro","Since I am upgrading from an earlier version of OP, some of the experience remains the same, for eg Andriod and Oxygen OS. The changes I liked. 1. Big screen display with 120Hz RR. Scrolling is much smoother now. A huge leap in display quality. 2. Alert slider takes little effort to operate. 3.Oxygen OS 10 is much more practical and smoother to operate. 4.Wifi/Internet speeds have definitely improved. 5.Improved haptics. 6.Addition of a Wide-angle lens. 7. Smoother graphics in PUBG, go for Balance-Extreme settings to extract maximum benefits out of this phone. 8. Wireless charging capabilities- Bought a 10W TPT wireless charger from Amazon. Dock it during working hours and you don't have to worry about picking calls during charging at all. Serves as a secondary screen and looks cool in office as well. 9.Front-firing speakers: They are awesome. One hardly appreciate this until they switch to another phone. What I didn't like. 1.Water fall display- Looks good but makes way for accidental touches. Also, some details like game settings go to the edge of the screen, one has to bend the phone to view and access it. I can see some green tint on edge sometimes, but it's barely noticeable. 2. Absence of dedicated notification LED, the edge notification is either not working or I have failed to notice it. 3.Finger print reader- Not as quick as dedicated FP reader found in OP 5T. 4. 4th Camera- The Photocrome: What were they thinking? Waste of space and resources. 5. Camera quality- My wife's iphone 11 which falls in similar price range has a better wide angle and night camera. Wide-angle lens is not so wide. Overall if you love speed,gaming and hate One UI or color UI, go for this phone.  My One Plus 5T lasted 3 years and hasn't slowed down a bit. The black crush issue under the front lens camera is not noticeable at all. Yeah, it's there but you won't notice it if you don't go looking for it. It's only noticeable under some special settings which I haven't tried. Will keep this phone until next big upgrade- under screen front cameras.","15 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Akshay DG","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good but not perfect","I have received OnePlus 8 Pro today, I observed few issues that I'm clearly tell you guys, as of now OnePlus not resolved balck bar issue and green tint issue in updates. Black bar issue won't affect in our day to day usage I think it's common I have seen other brand device also like samsung, vivo v19 etc, but green tint issue is comes from the bottom of the display you can notice while you are using in dark room with low light, if you open a black colour mix image uppar part purely black and lower part it's black mix green tone these test done after updates. Font Camera is not good as vivo 11 Pro. My last mob is v11 pro. Selfie camera has lack of beautiful effects in normal mode.

"The Beast from OnePlus - is 8 Pro","It's a Beast in Android mobiles, best and worth for the price which you pay. This review is after a 4 days of usage. No screen issues - no black bar, no green tint No heating issues - as many reviews said heating problem - I play high end games and it doesn't heat at all. Camera - at its best and it's not a flagship killer - it's a Flagship phone. Performance 10/10 Display 10/10 Camera- 9/10 - just comparing it with S20+ Front camera - 9/10 Built quality - 10/10 - premium you will feel the quality when holding it - mine is glacier Green Call quality - 10/10 Charging - quick as you blink - 10/10 Cons : Nothing and I don't think you will have any I have previously used oneplus2, Oneplus5, and now upgraded to 8pro.

The strategy in their marketing is tremendous and you know phones are marvellous in their segment...

"Very good phone but don't buy","I bought glacial green one plus 8 pro. I will make the review brief and concise and there will be no comparison to other smartphones. Version: 12gb 256gb Price: 56000 Display: beautiful, curved, bright display but has display issues in very low light and low brightness or while seeing a white or black screen. There is a yellow tint present. Refresh rate: 120hz doesn't seem very different until you back to your old device. You will instantly appreciate 120hz. Battery: getting 6.5 hrs screen on time when using on 1080p and 120hz Vibration motor: It's very very good on this device. They have tuned different levels on this based on the app. For best vibrations, you should go to clock app and test out. Camera: Great daylight performance, great low light performance, great ultrawide performance, poor selfie performance. Video is very good. Super macro mode is the best . Charging: Had charging issue on my device but when it charges properly it is very fast Speed and Performance: this is OnePlus, so there is no need to specially mention this. Features: alert slider and oxygen os covers all essential features you require. No complaints Fingerprint scanner and face ID: both are very good. Loved using fingerprint scanner Audio: very good, but the levels are not done well. Till 75% you will hear feeble sounds. After that it increases exponentially. At highest level, the sound is excellent and clear. Complaints: very few. OnePlus has to make sure that quality control while assembly or manufacturing has to be very good from now. Can't expect so many recalls of op8 pro because tiny display issues","04 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","susheel chandra","5.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great phone but with display problems","The phone is excellent except a single problem. The display has a dark band in the top running along the camera area which you can see clearly in the picture. It is visible in dark room and minimum brightness. I am returning it and would have to buy a new one in the next sale as they don't support replacement. That's really bad. I was really lucky that I got the phone in that sale after trying for more than 5 sales. Donno when am gonna get the product in the flash sale again. And also I had a really hard time in explaining about the issue with Amazon customer service while it is clearly visible in the photo. But somehow finally they approved it. Not completely happy though as it is not a replacement but just a refund. Hope OnePlus makes it on an open sale soon.","14 Jul 2020","Style name: 12GB RAM + 256GB Storage Colour: Glacial Green","","Yes","Melvin Meshach","3.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Glacial Green 12GB RAM+256GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-544/product-reviews/B077PWK5BY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"⚠️ Don't buy! Good on paper but too bad in performance ⚠️","Redmi has been a prominent smartphone brand which has given a quality product at a pocket-friendly price range. I have a lot of expectation from Xiaomi. I have used almost 4 of their smartphone in last 2 Years but truely disappointed with Note 8. I Won't use the complex word & would like to make the review very simple & to the point. The Negative things of Redmi Note 8 are:- (1) 😔 Battery drains very fast if you're using Wifi, low signal area & of course while gaming like PUBG & COD. Needs to recharge after 6-8 hours. But 18W Fast charging will help you to charge quickly but that doesn't solve the entire problem. (2) 😡 Can't disable pre-installed apps. Lots of annoying ads & Can't give these phone to someone new to android or smartphone (eg. Parents because of unnecessary ads & you need to be very careful to handle them). (4) 💥 Flashlight very poor ( Note 5 Pro, A3 & Note 8 Pro has better flash). (5) 👀 Unnecessarily forces to use location in all apps (which is most annoying). Why is Mi so much interested in our location? (6) 📷 The Quad camera works fine but zoom doesn't make much difference. Good for normal use & Justify the price segment. (7) 🤮 Everyone tries to make UI & Design as simple to operate but Xiaomi MiUi is so disgusting & difficult to operate. (8) 🤕 Apps crash here and there. I hope they will consider this in upcoming updates. (9) 🔥 Heating issue while charging the phone & while using it for even 30 minutes. ⚫ Overall: It is a nice phone for average use but if you're amazed by its so-called features & you think that it can survive your high-end requirement then be aware it is not for you.","09 Dec 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Aman Singh","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4PXKZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Highly recommended for people who doesn't want confusion on buying this price range...","To all consumers who are looking for a decent midrange smartphone today, this Redmi Note 8 is a solid pick. Ads? You can disable it on Settings, though disabling it one by one but worth it after doing it. Chipset? It's above average since it can play graphic demand games very well. Day to day work? So dang good. Transition between apps is no slouch. Compared to same level smartphones the display looks crispy, and speakers are powerful. At last, its highly customisable system brings a great experience for hard users. Cameras? Stock app is straight garbage (except the macro mode). Just install google Camera and you're good to go. Details will be flagship like. The battery it's good as well and gaming it's a ""just good"" experience, not bad at all (smooth on high preferences, not ultra) Price?

"The UNDISPUTED CHAMP OF THE BUDGET SEGMENT","I got this device on 1st November 1 week before our famous Jagadhatri Puja in Chandannagar and this was my best purchase till date. Design:- First of all this thing just glows. The very first moment I saw this phone I was literally drooling. The back and froth Gorilla Glass back gives this an unmatched premium feeling in the hand. So classy so elegant yet so eye catching and charming. At least 5-6 strangers have asked me about this device. This phone is sure a looker. Camera :- The camera can give competition to phones that are 2-3x more expensive than this. This phone with GCam 7 just blows the competition out of water, nothing even comes close.The GCam 7 works on this device so flawless without any lags or stutters whatsoever it's pure magic just see the samples, straight out of the camera. The selfies of this device are even better than iPhone 7 , I compared them side by side and the selfies frrom this one have better dynamic range, better contrast and better depth effect. Night Sight too works like a charm GCam7+ Redmi Note 8=♥️🔥 The addition of wideangle and macro are just cherry on the top. Wide Angle takes decent shots is good lighting conditions and you can take videos with the macro cam as well. Both does the job pretty well. I will give the GCam 7 link at the end🤗 Display:- The FullHD+ screen, yes a FullHD+ screen in a sub 10K phone, the screen is bright, vibrant produces great colour and contarsts and watching YouTube videos and movies makes the experience so much better. Performance:- 665 is a very well rounded SoC it's running very well, without any lags or hiccups experienced till date and PUBG runs pretty smooth without any lags and stutters whatsoever and this doesn't heats up at all. Battery and Charging :- I have experienced about 1 and 1/2 days of battery backup with moderate usage and thanks to the 18W fast Charge it charges up 0-80 in around 75mins. Speaker:- The downfiring speaker is very loud and crisp you can literally feel air pumping out of the speaker in a bass heavy song and the speaker has a self cleaning feature too. The earpiece is loud crisp  and clear too.This phone media consuming to much better. Extra Features:- IR blaster ✔️ Gorilla Glass 5 back and front great hand feel, premium built and scratch resistant✔️ Self cleaning speaker✔️ Wireless FM✔️ P2i coating✔️ USB C✔️ Fast 18W charger in the box✔️ Cons:- There are ads in the UI but a mere 5mins of tweaking and voila you will never see a ad in your device Very very difficult to get hold off one in these flash sales. Overall this phone is redefining what a budget phone can do, from a Great built quality with Gorilla Glass 5 on both front and back, with downright best camera in this segment, to the presence of great speakers, to the presence of P2i water resistant coating which gives a great peace of mind to the presence of IR blaster, Wireless FM to the presence of USB C this phone is a perfect from every department no phone even comes close. If your budget is within Rs 12000 this is the best buy you can buy just go for it✌️ Fair warning:- After using the GCam 7 on this device you will have a difficult time switching to any other phone even 2-3x more expensive cause the picture quality produced by this phone is just lit. Get this phone asap and Install GCam 7 and let this perfect combo amaze you♥️🔥 Thanks for reading this review if you find this helpful like this and have a great day.","06 Jan 2020","Colour: Moonlight White Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Kushal Dutta","5.0","Redmi Note 8 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4PXKZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Budget King | But NOT for Gamers","If you are planning to buy Redmi Note 8, check my experience as follows Pro's : 1. Camera: 48 MP Quad camera gives well exposed output. Note 8's camera is one of the Best in under 10k price segment. - It also have ultra-wide, macro depth sensor. - Front camera is also great. - Capable to shoot 4k 30 fps, slow motion 120 fps. 2. Snapdragon 665: which is handles daily to day multitasking pretty well. 3. 4000 mAH Battery: easily lasts for a day, 18 watt charger included inside box which helps to charge mobile fully in 2 hours. 4. Notification LED. 5. IR Blaster. 6. Dedicated SD card slot. 7. Headphone jack. 8. Gorrila glass 5 on front and back. Con's: - When playing PUBG with high settings, sometime it lags with frame drops. Verdict: If you are looking for phone for daily use with amazing camera quality, then Note 8 is right choice for you. But if looking for gaming then don't buy this one.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Bhushan","4.0","Redmi Note 8 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4PXKZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not a smooth ride","After all the hype I managed to buy the blue colour variant 4GB/64 GB. My initial impressions were very disappointing and after using the phone for two weekks I can safely say that phone has some bugs and quallity issues which I would like to mention: 1) Biggest flaw is notification icons disappearing from the notification shade after appearing for few seconds. I tried my best to fix it by going through number of suggestions available on internet including factory reset. Hopefully Xiaomi will try to fix it. 2) The flashlight/torch is very weak and even my older Redmi Note 3 has brighter torch/flashlight. 3)Camera is pretty average and hard to believe how the 48 mp mode is giving average pictures. Wide angle mode is also poor and the other two modes are in my opinion just gimmick. 4)One basic flaw if you are using two sims the second sim icon will be displayed only when you are using wifi. I am really disappointed with these bugs/defects and just hope this is my last association with Xiaomi. Last but not thr least if you are looking for a ohone with great experience of gaming then you should not opt for this phone. To conclude if you are a Xiaomi fan just opt for 10k version and hope that some of the errors mentioned above are fixed by Xiaomi. Review after MIUI 11 Update:- I got an OTA for MIUI 11 on 27th November 2019. After the update the problem of disappearing notification icons from the notification shade has been solved. Second sim icon is also now displayed in the notification shade which was earlier missing. I can now say without any hesitation that this is the best phone in 10k range.","13 Nov 2019","Colour: Neptune Blue Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Sanjeev Kumar Verma","3.0","Redmi Note 8 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4PXKZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good phone with few irritating discrepancies","side & Bottom border area keyboard keys are not working properly, like p, q, capslock, backspace, '?123', navigation keys like back, home etc. Sometimes they work sometimes they don't, it's very irritating when you have to correct spelling by deleting the misspelt word due to miss of the letter. At least 3 out of 10 hits are missing regularly. In addition to it, voice during the call is leaking in the earpiece, it's like I am hearing my own voice while talking. Poor feeling. Otherwise, the phone is working fine. Didn't expect this from such a brand. Really disappointed ------------------------------------------REPLACED------------------------------------ Got it replaced with another handset, though the keys I mentioned above seem to be responding fine now, other areas are giving similar problem, like the 'abc' key which is used to switch the keyboard from letters to number and symbols. Also, after dropping down the notification shade the setting gear icon is not responding properly.  Screen touch issues lies in many places over the screen. So the hit-miss pattern is still on but on some other areas. This is very irritating. The voice leak during call still lingering over some or other calls.","07 Nov 2019","Colour: Space Black Size name: 4+64GB","","Yes","Nitin Garg","2.0","Redmi Note 8 (Space Black, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-Note-Space-Black-Storage/product-reviews/B07X4PXKZ7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Good Phone at 9k","I have been using it for a week. I came back to samsung after using Redmi note and it feels so much better. The touch and feel iss awesome. Fast an smooth operations with anroid 10. Lots of intelligent features at this price like limiting screen time for each app and winddown function in the night etc.. Camera is decent for normal photo. Sound and speakers are good for clear conversations. The only thing which might be a downside for some people'could be compact size of screen especially if you're used to big screens. It might take some time to get accustomed if you are a frequent movie watcher. Overall it's much better than the so called value for money brands like Redmi Oppo Vivo Realme etc which are primarily winning customers by offering more storage battery and big screen but lack performance. A good to buy phone for  9000","07 Jul 2020","","","Yes","I D Rathod","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M01 (Black, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Samsung-Galaxy-Storage-Additional-Exchange/product-reviews/B086KCCMCP/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"All rounder","Reviewing after 5 days. Design feels solid as front and back both protected by gorilla glass 6. Easy to hold. Not bulky. Weight around 185 grams. Which is well distributed. Piano black color is descent. Comes with Android 10. Display is amoled. Shifted from ips display. Finding amoled display much better. Display size is 6.44 inches. So phone is not too big. Touch response is smooth. No lags or hanging. Works very smooth Haven't played games yet Charges fast. Gets slightly warm while charging as it 33 watts fast charging but does not heat or overheat Earphones are gud. Although design feels like copied from Samsung s20 ultra. Speakers are loud amd clear. No network issue till now. Earpiece quality is gud and mic also receive the audio properly. There is call recording option and native video calling Option. Triple card slot. Much required. 6 cameras- 4 in the back and 2 in the front. Cameras are gud. Sometimes there are issues in exposure while capturing through front camera. Background is blown out. But it can be adjusted before or after clicking the image. After adjusting exposure,pics comes quite natural and detailed. Rear Camera has pro mode. Images from back camera are really gud, natural, detailed, sharp. Video recording upto 4k 30 fps. 1080p 60 fps also available. Lots of customization features. Coming to price. Too much. Considering the fact it is offline centric. 22k should have been the price with some additional offers. Back cover provided is really gud. Fits tightly.","08 Jun 2020","Colour: Piano Black Size name: 128 GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Milan jeswani","5.0","Vivo V19 (Mystic Silver, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Vivo-Mystic-Storage-Additional-Exchange/product-reviews/B08444XXKV/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"not worth for money","This phone is not worth for 28k, performance is very bad. After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review. 1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous. 2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark. A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode. B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser. C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue. Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues.

"Best Bang For Your Bucks","Well as they say this is indeed the best phone in the price range of ₹25000. If budget permits then go for RealmeX2 Pro for ₹30000 or OnePlus 7T for ₹35000 or more and if it doesn't the go for Realme X2/Redmi K20 for ₹20000. But for the price of ₹25K you are getting: 6.4 inch Horizon Amoled Display (Crisp & Vivid) SD 855 Flagship Processor (Fast & Powerful) 48MP Sony 586 Primary Camera (True Snap) 13MP Ultra Wide Camera ( Truly Wide) 8MP Telephoto with 2X Zoom Accurate In-display finger print sensor Full screen No Noch display 20MP pop-up Selfie snapper 6/128 GB or 8/256 GB storage options What else one needs. Now as far as day to day performance is concerned it's absolutely fantastic. Day camera is brilliant and even night camera with flash takes really stunning photos. Display gives vibrant and punchy colours to enjoy your daily video content and game play. Bottom firing speaker is loud and crisp. Earpiece is sound is cristal clear and loud too. It's also supportsHDR10 and DRM Widevine L1. So just go for it without any doubts if your budget is ₹25K. Also it has no other competitors in that range.","25 Dec 2019","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Indrani Das","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great device to have...","I have been using this phone for 10 days now. It's a total worth for the price. I got it in a exchnage with extra 3,000 offer on exchange. Talking about the device, the screen is emersive and bright, love to watch videos on this device. Cameras are superb. Performence is undoubtedly superb. Battery life is good too, if you don't play PUBG, u will going to get a day life easily or probably more. The phone is bit on the heavier side. I moved from Poco F1 to this one and surely this is heavier than Poco F1. All in all a great purchase.","01 Feb 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","Ashish","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best device under 25000","Display: I just fall in love with this phone's amoled screen.  I use my phone mostly for watching videos on youtube and binge watching on Amazon prime so I'm really happy with this phone's display. Viewing angles and deeper blacks in the display are amazing. If you a movie lover you willl fall in love with this phone. Apart from this the display is buttery smooth and responsive. 60hz display is still good as it consumes less battery. If you haven't used 90hz display is past then you won't gonna miss anything. Performance: It's a beast when it comes to day to day usage. Ram management is great. There's no lag at all. Thanks to the UFS 2.0 storage, the app opening time is very less. The phone boot time is very less and can opened in just few seconds. Gaming performance is great there's no lag at all. You will love playing heavy games Asphalt 9, Call of duty and pubg on it. Phone's has all the sensors in it and picking up all the right spots. Processor is 855 Snapdragon which is the flagship and it won't disappoint you. Battery life: I'm a power user so my phone's battery last for about 6-7 hours which is great. If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone. Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones. OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool. Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me. The network reception in my house is prettty bad and most of the phone's failed in network connectivity but this one is a beast. It has a great network reception and the call quality of the the phone is just outstanding. The wifi speed you get in this device is unmatched and i am just loving it. Audio quality: The audio quality of this phone is great you can listen to Hi Resolution audio songs with ease if you use a earphone that supports high resolution. I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you. I will give it a 10/10 in audio section. So lets look at the overall ratings: Display : 10/10 Battery performance: 10/10 Fast charging: 8/10 Ram management: 10/10 Booting time : 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Network reception: 10/10 Call quality: 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Rear camera: 10/10 Selfie camera: 7/10 Video recording 8.5/10 Audio quality: 10/10 It's a value for money phone and I'm gonna give it a 10/10 in value for money section. I recommend you to go for 128 gb storgage and 6 gb ram variant as it will give you more value for money. The cost of 128 gb/6gb varient is 25000 and in deals you can easily get it at around 24000. Moreover, if you exchange an older cheap handset with this one you can significantly reduce the overall cost. I have exchanged my old device and bought this one for 18148 rs. So just go for it.","02 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Mandeep","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for money Flagship, Just go for it.","Camera performance is okay, Battery is okay. Superfast processor for gamers. Full view display with Pop-up front Cam is what I like. Super Amoled display, 4000mAh battery with 27W fast charging support is just amazing.  Fingerprint reader is not up to the mark. Don't try Face unlock. I have been using it since last 1 month, no problems till now. I got it at Rs. 23000/- with SBI card offer and with 6 months No Cost EMI. At this price its best in the market. Edit 1- Regarding battery performance, it's getting better with updates. Edit 2- After 6 months, I can say it was amazing deal at that time. Now GST has increased from 12% to 18%, so the prices are gone up. I have received MIUI 12 update and user experience just got amazing. It's full view Super Amoled display with Snapdragon 855.

JIO and IDEA 4G not supported and does not work properly, even my previous 4 yrs old mobile has better speed. There are few solutions given over internet suggesting changes to APN etc. however that was not required to any other ordinary phones.. and those solutions do not work. Secondly MI is forcing users to use their browser over google chrome ( as they acknowledge the issue but don't care to resolve) which can be security threat.

"Awesome phone at such a cheap price","I only write reviews when I genuinely feel something is worth it. This phone is superb at this price range. **********Pros********** * Processor : Qualcomm SM8150 Snapdragon 855 (7 nm) : Do I need to say anything about this processor. * Battery Capacity 4000mAh : Battery is amazing. It lasts really long with gaming and otherwise. * AMOLED capacitive touchscreen : The screen display is outstanding. * Corning Gorilla Glass 5 : This really protects against any scratches on the phone display but it is always better to buy a screen guard. * FIngerprint sensor: This works like a charm. It is on screen since it is an Amoled display. * Call quality: Loud and clear * Design: Very attractive * Fast charging : Quick Charge 4.0 - It charges the phone really fast, personal experience. The fastest charging title, comparing all the phones goes to Realme X2 Pro I guess (as of now). Cons * No expandable storage : For me 128 GB is more than enough * Pop-up camera for unlocking the phone: For me no issue since I don't use this feature. For many it might be * Camera can be made better: It is good but can be better. Come on, at this price what more do you want. Overall performance: 10/10 Battery life: 10/10 Display: 10/10 Design: 10/10 Camera: 8/10 Software: 8/10 since I like iOS better than any Android version. If you are buying this phone for superb gaming experience and day to day usage then go for it.

"Great camera, Amazing Builb quality, poor selfie cam","The phone is surely a winner. The camera is the main highlight. It sure is the best camera Redmi has produced . The main primary camera is really nice. The images are vibrant ane has a lot of depth. The Bokeh shots and portrait shots are really nice. The wide angle shots aren't the best though. But the selfie camera is a huge let down. The same crappy redmi camera. The built quality is par excellence, the fit and feel is top notch. The glass body and metal is really nice and we'll built. The display is a bliss to look at. The full display is dream come true. Although the Redmi ui is not the first go to option it grows on you and adding a theme or skin makes it better. The battery backup is good and the quick charging is a saver ! Fingerprint reader is fast as I can tell. The face recognition doesn't get you during dark.","05 Aug 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Adnan Ali","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Does the job","Writing a review after 2 days of usage: Initial feel and look are quite premium, the back is glossy and in hand feel is that of a premium smartphone. Usage and installation is pretty smooth, Snapdragon 855 is bang on the buck, processor is extremely fast, with no lag whatsoever, even after opening 5-6 apps at the same time. Camera quality is pretty average, did not find any pixelation but the color sharpness and contrast are not that great as 1 would expect, selfie camera beautification feature is something i do not like, makes you look overly animated. Battery life is not good, for 4000 mah i expected it to last atleast an entire day without charging, but somehow it disappoints in that area (my usage is very heavy though) 128gb is sufficient initially, but no expandable slot makes me worry that i might have to manage the data i keep on my phone and might have to move some to an external source later down the line. Gameplay is extremely smooth with no lag and touch sensitivity is flawless. Fingerprint reader is pretty efficient and will get it right 9/10 times, might have to delete old prints and re-do them if you install a temper glass. Overall a decent option at this price-range","09 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Charanpreet sehgal","3.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros :- *)Mobile is Easy to hold *)Good display *)Better Camera *)Best Gaming *)Awesome Sound *)Good call quality & signal reception *)A class look with front back glass. *)In Heavy Use The phone last one day. ( If charge is 100 in morning ). If the phone is used for continuous screen on and gaming etc. The phone will only last 6-8 hrs. *) Fully charge in 1 hour 20 mts.

Great sets of cameras, which can be further improved upon by porting Google Camera. Quite decent battery.

"Wish to replace the device, facing issues with performance of the device","I purchased the 6 gb variant and the phone was delivered on 21st March, 2020 and since then I've been facing some issues with the device. First: The device has a really heavy UI that consumes 50% of the Ram... I bought a flagship device for smooth functioning and this device doesn't seem to deliver the same. Second: Almost everyday the screen goes blank while I'm using it and no matter how much I wait it doesn't light back up, I only see the fingerprint blinking and I need to restart it to get back the device to start functioning again. Third: While I'm typing a message or even this review, it suddenly shuts the app and take me to the home screen and then I've to open the app from the recent apps to get back to the work I'm doing. Fourth: I wish to replace the device but Amazon only gives me the option to return it... If I return it how will I get the device I exchanged it with..?

"A better option is available, ALWAYS!","Xiaomi K20 pro is undoubtedly a good phone. Here are a few of Pros and cons, I could share after around 4 months of usage. Pros: - Camera (IMX586 sensor) - Bright AMOLED panel - SD855 processor - Good Battery life (lasts around 10-12 hrs for me with 100% data on, web browsing, social medias browsing, 1-1.30 hrs of 4G calls) - Last but no least : Head Phone jack and Notification Light Cons : - Higher refresh rate (90, 120, 144 hz) panels available in market with Flagship phones. - Touch sampling refresh rate could have been improved. - Worst UI : ads popping out of nowhere in every app. Xiaomi need to stop selling ads for flagship level phones. If someone spending this much on a phone and still ads are popping of nowhere, this is very irritating. - Upgraded/overclocked version of 855 could have been used instead. Though the phone is good, you get good clicks from Sony's IMX586 (a flagship sensor of its time). Battery life is average. Phones looks average to me. Verdict : Realme X2 pro could have been considered, would have to compromise with camera but HDR and 90 hz panel would be available. Along side, for a good UI OnePlus 7T would always be a good choice, if headphone jack is not a priority. Again, being Indian, this would be my last Chinese owned company's phone/gadget. Have used Samsung's Note 2, S4, S7 Edge, and S8. Now, would again go back for Samsung's phones for better hardware quality and best in class UI.","12 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","Harbhajan Singh","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The true flagship killer.","This was without a doubt the true flagship killer. And even a year after its release, Snapdragon 855 beats all the new generation mid-tier processors by a huge margin. This is quite interesting considering the fact that a lot of your mid-tier phones are now more expensive than the K20 pro. This phone truly has it all - a beautiful AMOLED display, sliding cameras that seem to be pretty well built and sturdy, all the important cameras that you'll actually need at the back (main camera, zoom and ultra wide). The phone looks amazing, feels amazing and works perfectly. If I have to nitpick what I don't like about it, it would be the size (a prefer smaller phones, though this is still smaller than similar phones), the slower fingerprint reader (which wasn't too much of an issue for me at least) and maybe it would be cooler with a 90hz screen (which seems more like a bonus than a necessity).","11 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Areeb","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best in range","Best mobile in 25k range. With dark mode and pixel icon pack the mobile looks super premium, nice haptic feedback,high performance.But front camera performance is just average. Display is awesome. After 3 months Nothing has changed in the performance , camera got even better with updates. BUT , feeling really disappointed because the color coating on the side rim is getting off. Its really frustrating whenever i look at the phone because the phone is no longer looking premium due to that color getting off.

"FLAGSHIP KILLER","Pros : Amoled display is wonderful and giving me great experience I switched from Vivo V5s So I'm really excited and satisfed about this Battery life: Yes battery life is pretty decent for a pubg match in Full HD mode drains about 7-8 percent of battery sometimes 10 Processor: it's a flagship killer and no need to talk about this at all. It's awesome 3.5mm jack Pop up camera is also fast and its light and music sounds cool Notification light on pop up is top-notch Fingerprint: personally I didn't  like in display sensor it's accurate but finger need be placed in some exact position but it's fast Camera and vedio: though it's triple camera still its a big hit camera is awesome no doubt about this Design: it's of pure glass and protected by Gorilla glass 5 design is mind blowing Cons: heating issues,normally phone never raises it's temperature but if you play games after playing you can make dosas on phone graphite cooling they have mentioned but I didn't find it working FAST CHARGING: It's not that fast coz it's just 18W takes 1+ hr to charge completely but k20pro supports 27W if you buy the charger paying 999 it could be even more faster MIUI : sometimes os gets you into trouble you need to click on same tab or screen twice still dosent work but can be solved by software update Price is high and its not con beacuse this  mobile is combination of Snapdragon 855 also comes with amoled display so price will be 25 itself One thing is I brought it after 1 year of its release and still I'm satisfied I got it for 25,499","02 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Vamshi Deekshith","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Costly in today's market","Writing this review after almost 10 days of usage. Let me write the Pros and Cons. PROS: Battery life: Decent battery life. But I compeltely discharged and 100% charged the phone twice after getting it. Since then operating it in the 30-90% range. The 18 watt charger does a decent job in charging it till 90% after which I dont charge it further. Camera: Decent quality camera. Better than my wife's Samsung M30. But dont expect flagship level pics. Its impressive, not excellent. Processor: Snapdragon 855 is a benchmark itself. However I am not a gamer. Still a good processor along with Amoled screen helps to get a better battery life. Display: Very natural display that you expect from an Amoled screen. Better than Samsung M30 again. Style: If looks could kill. 10/10 for the style. Just love it. Os: Had some bloatware. Removed it quickly. Not getting much Ads too. Now the updated MIUI 11 works like a charm. Call quality: Has a decent call quality which is absent in mid range MI phones. Loudspeaker: The mono speaker does a great job too. CONS: 1) Screen response: The screen is not smooth which you expect from a phone in this price range. No 90Hz display too. 2) Finger print sensor: The on screen fingerprint sensor is pathetic. Does not work most of the time. Conclusion: You get what you pay for. Its 10K cheaper than the 1plus 7t. And the quality is compromised according to the price as well. But it has a 855 processor which you wont get in below 20k phones. And the Amoled screen is not wonderful. One plus has a much better display. So you may consider other phones in this range like the newly launched Realme X3 etc.","10 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Suryendu Das","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Over All 5*","What I like is firstly the speed of SD 855. The feel in hand and display is really good. For 🤳 in good light the pictures could match with the best. For rear pictures though the quality is good in poor light I don't know for sure. Also I need to understand it better however I am not to deep into pictures and primarily for work it is amazing the speed and smooth interfacing. Battery life is quite ok too,been using it.for over 3 months Finger print reader works but staggers around and there is just one speaker at the bottom. Also MI pushes a lot of their own stuff like at every opportunity it directs you to MI browser instead of the Google Chrome, beware ofnthat as a lotta unnecessary stuff just latches on to the device.","26 Feb 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Shishir D.","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Glacier Blue, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Glacier-Storage/product-reviews/B082FN4LRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Just grab it...","Best flagship phone at best price. I got at 19200(12 no cost emi) with exchange of redmi go. Rear camera is beast... potrait mode marvelous. Front pop up camera is average. Amoled Screen is very good,gives you premium feel. Battery performance superb. I'm getting 9-10 hours screen time. Took approx 1.30 hours to full charge, but it supports 27 watt charger which have to purchase seperately. Flagship Processor working very fine, no lags, works very smooth.

There is nothing in this phone except bigger battery and side fingerprint 2. They are advertising top gaming GPU, but the games like COD PUBG loads slower than Redmi note 8 3. Takes very long for full charge, 4-5 hours 4. I have faced glitches while playing games, like sound stops or decreases on its own 5.

"Good looking phone but feel outdated as per market trade","Good looking phone due to glass panel. After handling won't make it up to the mark as compare the price. The display lacks the response as compared to the same price tag mobiles in the market. Also, Mi claims FHD+ display but looks very outdated screen; It may be because of a low refresh rate. Face recognition for unlocking screen work slightly slower as compared with other brands. The placing of the rear camera looks very premium. But as per the current trade-in market, the company provided 48MP seems very outdated. Over the period, the rear camera will be getting lots of scratches, even if you have the protective cover to the mobile. The mobile comes with Fast charging by 18W, which is very slow as considering the 5000 mAh battery. To charge the mobile completely, it takes ~2hr. As per current trade, Mi should provide a 28W or 30W charger. The company offered Clear soft case, which is very cheap quality and it is not clear. It looks just some very cheap robber soft case. Lastly, the mobile comes with 3.5 jack for headphones, and people always prefer to buy a Bluetooth headset. I feel; instead, a 3.5 jack company should offer the dual speaker.","22 Mar 2020","","","Yes","Santosh Jagade","2.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-552/product-reviews/B0784D862M/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

For that i should appreciated Amazon. first impression- phone is perfect as the title given by Redmi, it is a performance beast. But on fourth day, device started showing an issue with display backlight. The backlight LEDs stopped functioning. On full brightness there was no light on display.May be this is an issue with particular device. But I'm disappointed.","30 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Unnikrishnan","3.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-552/product-reviews/B0784D862M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Solid option under 20k","Overall, the phone is great for every day usage. In my opinion, the drop in mega pixels from 64 to 48 didn't have a major effect on picture quality. I am still being able to take great pictures. The pro mode is also quite useful if you know how to use it. Regarding gaming, I have tested out PUBG Mobile on it. The gameplay is quite good even on a high graphics and frame rate setting. The Snapdragon 720G combined with 6GB of RAM sure provides a great gaming experience. The phone is a little fragile though so I'd recommend purchasing a separate cover with the phone as the cover which comes in the box is not of a good quality. The battery life is amazing. It lasts over 1½ days easily. The 18W charger is also good but it would certainly be much better if Xiaomi provided a 30W fast charger since the large battery capacity means that the time to charge will also be high.","31 May 2020","","","Yes","Debarun Das","5.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-552/product-reviews/B0784D862M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Unparalleled performance. Superb battery life.","Using this phone since 3 months now. Bought it in the launch sale. You can't get a better processor in this range (except the Redmi Note 7 Pro that has Snapdragon 675 which is better than 720G). Battery life is something which I've never experienced before. The only thing that could have been better is the display. But I have no complaints as you can't get so much in this range. Don't buy Realme. My cousin bought the Realme equivalent of this and it's disastrous.","16 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Yash Burhade","4.0","Redmi Note 9 Pro (Interstellar Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage) - Latest 8nm Snapdragon 720G & Gorilla Glass 5 Protection","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-552/product-reviews/B0784D862M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"It’s an Iphone. Obviously worth it.","It’s a very good phone. The screen quality is very defining. While i was using the IOS 12, the battery was drained very quickly. After the update to IOS 13.5, the battery life is optimised very well. The consumption of battery charge is down to 1:3 compare to IOS 12. The camera quality is very good esp the portrait mode. If you are using this phone, please update to IOS 13.5. After that this is a beast.","12 Jun 2020","","","Yes","Burnett Z.

"A solid phone even in 2020","Bought the space grey 64gb version for Rs. 42,000 Pros: Camera is pretty decent till date. Using a third party software for night mode gets the job done. Performance is blazing fast even in 2020 (obviously it’s iOS). Stereo speakers work pretty fine. Should be getting iOS updates for the next 3-4 years for its given hardware specifications. Touch ID: With corona situation, no use of Face ID. Additionally Touch ID is faster than Face ID in various cases. Cons: Charging speed isn’t great so get a 15w fast charger externally. Single handed usage: NO With its fragile glass back, impossible to have the device naked. If you’re looking for a device which isn’t having the design language of 2020, but features which are practical such as wireless charging, ip67 waterproof rating, better battery life, good gaming performance and a decent camera without emptying your wallet, this is the best you can get. A best alternative for iPhone SE 2020, if you wouldn’t mind the massive size of iPhone 8 Plus. Finally, my personal advice: Do not spend extra 25-30K on a device just to say its name. This gets the job done. These phones are very close to their tech.","22 Jul 2020","","","Yes","Rahul","5.0","Apple iPhone 8 Plus (64GB) - Gold","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Gold-64GB/product-reviews/B071HWTHBK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Iphone and you......","There has been a craze among people to attain at least an Iphone, irrespective of the product being latest or a bit old edition, during lifetime. As far as I am concerned,it has been a sheer dream to lay my hands on this incredible product, feel the difference in texture and bask in the glorious legacy of technological supremacy. No feeling is as precious as the one which brings in contentment. The model Iphone 8 plus was released in 2017 and the manufacturing date of the product purchased is August 2018. The battery was completely drained out and I had to put it on charging. Generally, what happens is a new device never goes out of its charge at the time of opening the package and I have found that recently while opening the Ipad with the battery being 85%  charge left. From this end, it was a mild shock at the beginning that eventually ebbed away with the finding of getting it charged later. It took more than three hours to get it 100% charged. Then, it has been a sheer pleasure that fills you with. Incredibly different and being different from others is a boon . The review section has been flooded with technicalities -- divided with pros and cons, but to me the moment the device is felt in my hand, I will treasure that moment and it will be secretly kept in my heart forever. The last but not the least, Amazon should be appreciated for such a speedy delivery -- less than 24 hours had been taken to deliver the shipment. In the field of authenticity, the seller- Appario Pvt Ltd, has been incredibly trustworthy as both my Ipad and now Iphone were purchased through this entity. Authenticity is a major issue in the era of counterfeiting and the seller should be admired profusely in this segment as a customer deserves nothing but an authentic product and discounts won't help much if a certain product is found to be fake. Time will prove if my first ever Iphone laced with dream and expectation passes the test of endurance with flying colours.","22 Jul 2020","Colour: Gold Size name: 64GB","","Yes","Biplab Chakraborty","5.0","Apple iPhone 8 Plus (64GB) - Gold","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Gold-64GB/product-reviews/B071HWTHBK/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"An amazing iPhone at an amazing price!","It’s an iPhone after all! I would like to review it on some basic points. Camera - The camera is brilliant. It’s an upgrade to 7plus camera, with better portrait mode and beta lighting. Although no wide angle lens is available in this module, yet it captures awesome shots. Battery - iPhone is not widely known for a terrific  battery performance, so it’s standard wrt apple phones. It definitely delivers improved battery life than its previous generations. Built quality- Aesthetically an amazing piece. Smooth glass back with aerospace graded aluminium structure give a perfect premium look. Display- Apple engineered Hd Retina display. It may not be an Led or Qled, but you will never complain about the display. It’s cool and handsome for movie and video watching. Sound- Louder than previous generation and delivers crisp sound with perfect clarity. Although it belongs to 2017 iPhone line-up, yet its A-11 bionic chip is any day faster and dynamic compared to presently available android phones. You can have a beast in terms of performance. If someone is okay with the thick bezel and traditional iPhone design with the same touch id and ips display, this might be the best option. Amazon offered it for ₹42k, which seems to be a great deal. Am impressed.","28 Jul 2020","Colour: Gold Size name: 64GB","","Yes","Subhranil","5.0","Apple iPhone 8 Plus (64GB) - Gold","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-Plus-Gold-64GB/product-reviews/B071HWTHBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"I was happy when they released a 64GB not just 128 and 32!","No compromise on the quality! Have been blowing it with high end film making apps!

"Keep away from Amazon when it's Apple.","May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.","20 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","Suman Biswas","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"First Time iPhone User Review :-)","The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome. Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging. The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant). Cons: 1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears. 2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger. Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro). But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Sunny Kumar","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

"iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals","This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.","13 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Keshav Alur","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi]. After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

"Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB","This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good.

Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there. But my answer would be, GO FOR IT. I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC. No doubts remain anymore. Well that being said, nothing is permanent. I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone. Keep it up. Good delivery, on time. Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight. I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints. Delivery: Good. Product Packaging: Very Good. Notifications: Good. Shopping Experience: Good.

"Best thing that money can buy","Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11.

"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers.. Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years. Sound & Call Quality also Network Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent! Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection. Camera: The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P I would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!","02 Feb 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Jyotsna","3.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The iPhone for everyone!","Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out. First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that. Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one. ✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry. ✅ All-day battery life. ✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance. ✅ Wireless charging ✅ An extra ultra-wide camera ✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now) ✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features. But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical. A high recommendation for this product.","27 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Saif Ur Rahman","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Minor damage to the product","There is a minor Scratch to the glass on the front end it’s only visible when viewed in light properly it seems like a thread from cloth also when you touch that area nothing is felt . Is exchange of the item possible ? Although since it’s Amazon fulfilled I was care free that there would no Damage only after 2 days I was able to notice the damage although everything else looks fine . It would be great if exchange is made possible coz at the end of the day so much money is put into it .

But this phone is defective, it failed to update, failed to connect to servers Finding no other solution, I used old version of iOS hoping it will work fine but it is not working fine, everytime it hangs and I am not able to work today while putting it for charging there was a blast in the battery and since then it is not working I have just exceeded return period, perhaps my 70 thousand is now gone down the drain","24 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","gaurav garg","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best in class","I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years. Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal. On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism. Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised. Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D. And Jus for a note..this last year flagship can throw the samsung s20 ultra and run circles around it on the performace level.","21 Jun 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Red","","Yes","Adithya Gopikrishnan","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (128GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-128GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVLMXYH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"One trillion operations per second","Bought iPhone 11 recently. I must admit - this phone is super cool. Design is good. Purple color looks fresh & soothing to your eyes. I was confused between mint green & this color but when i compared both at one of the apple stores, i just couldn't resist ordering the purple. During the launch of the phone, the new two cameras design appeared weird but when you unbox the phone it looks Stunning. Night mode is also too good. Looks more natural & true to life.

"A perfect device for average device user","I was looking for a budget smart phone which can perform the entire task for me. I was using MI note 6 and looking for something fresh bcz I was bored with it’s UI. I explored the content available over internet and waited for it to buy after getting the right fitment against my requirement. I am so excited to share my personal experience after my early purchase of this device. I love taking pictures of mine and surrounding too. So great camera quality is one of my main priority, after using it now I must say that it has the best camera available in this budget. It’s plastic made but mirror finish back panel is the coolest thing in my blue colour device. I also appreciate the makers for understanding our further need and offering the tempered glass and transparent back cover for device protection. Once you will keep the device handy it will give you a feel of it. With the brand tag line of Vivo “Camera & Music” it really impressed me. I’ll surely recommend my fellow buyers to buy this cool device. But there is also something which can be improved so writing it in bullet points for your ease.. Pros:- ● It’s really a 100% value for money device. ● Run on latest version of Android “9”. ● In Box soft back cover and tempered glass. ● Dedicated kid mode for safety against unwanted operational activity of kids ● Finger print sensor in back of the device is at perfectly placed in the reach of fingers and open the device faster. ● 5000Ah battery, allows to watch many hours online video ● HD+ screen Resolution and balanced colour contrast makes the viewing experience really pleasure and never hurt eyes ● Triple camera with AI and image editing options are among the best features for me ● Fast charging support with 18 watt inbox adaptor ● Snapdragon 665 processor is really a power pack performer even in multitasking Cons:- ● Lags in PubG (However in a device with 4 GB it’s expected as the game itself take 2 GB space) ● No headphones included ● Front Camera struggles in low light. At the price of 10990 its a great phone for better multitasking. Vivo has finally started improving specs and is doing good with their phones in the segment. I hope my review helped you in making your right decision!","30 Sep 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Electric Blue Size name: 4GB+64GB","","Yes","Priyanka Kumari","5.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"PL read my response before you leap","The phone is good but has the following pro/cons. I had purchased this phone on 28 sep and after using it for a week this is what I have to say . 1. Perf- The performance of the phone is good with all latest features like finger print sensor AI camera and the latest processor. 2. Charging- The phonephone charges quickly and it is helpful in emergency. 3. Torch light- Though the phone claims to have a 5000a Ah battery the torch light is weak 4. Camera- The camera is not at all impressive though the firm claims to have a triple camera the picture gets blurred on zooming and there are black patches on facial images. 5. I had requested a replacement and the above issues persists in both the phones hence it is not an isolated case, don't know if its a manufacturing flaw. The first phone had an addl issue with finger print sensor in addition to the above issues. 6. Have requested for a firm inspection from Amazon, awaiting their response. 7. Friends my sincere advice on new product launches never go for it, the firms are testing on us as guinea pigs.There are no refund policy as the same is covered only by a replacement policy by our so called ""Earth's Most Customer-Centric Company"". Amazon please train your staff to understand the customers standpoint and speak the language of the customer and not of the seller or the firm only then you can claim to be customer- centric Please do change your policy. 8.Amazon please ensure that such high end products are packed in tamper proof sealed covers as claimed by your team the replacement phone was not packed as the first phone.","15 Oct 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Electric Blue Size name: 3GB+32GB","","Yes","Hari Kumar","2.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Not recommended if you want to click pictures!","Worst product under 11K range. I'm even afraid to write that camera is below expectations. I'd say camera is worst in the history of mobile phones till now. A 0.2 MP camera of Motorola would have been better than the 8 MP front camera of this phone. The corners of objects in the picture aren't clear and seem to get mixed with colours around. The main camera is a clear fraud in the name of triple camera.

"Detailed review for this Great phone ♥️","Sorry for late review! Phone looks absolutely beautiful! Feels real premium in hand. You won't feel like it costs less than 10k. They have provided a 18W fast charger, documents, SIM ejector pin, USB cable, a durable transparent back cover and a screen guard (you can continue to use this screen guard, it's good) within the box. PURCHASE OF EXTRA SCREEN GUARD AND BACK COVER IS OPTIONAL AS EVERYTHING IS INCLUDED. Now coming to Pros- *Fast charger is good. *Battery life is amazing *Display quality is really good for this price *Phone feels sturdy in hand *Phone is fast and responsive *Back cover and screenguard are provided *Many customisations possible *Android 9 with September Update *Wide angle lens *Face unlock is very fast *5000mAH battery is a beast Cons- *No earphones *Bloatwares (unnecessary softwares) *Camera performance in artificial light is poor. Struggles while focusing *White coloured charger and cable *No notification LED (but flashlight can be used as notification LED) *No options for disabling unnecessary system softwares *Heats up a bit (Normal) Overall the phone is amazing for this price tag!! Buy this device without any doubt. Contact me for further questions.

"4 ⭐ Very good phone, 2 day batter and great specs under 10k. Camera can be improved","----------------------------- 📦 IN THE PACKAGE ----------------------------- ◾ Vivo U10 phone ◾ Transparent silicone case ◾ SIM ejector pin ◾ Some Literatures ◾ USB to Micro-USB cable with 9V/2A Fast Charger ------------------------------ 🖊️ SPECIFICATIONS ------------------------------ ◾ 5000 mah battery with 18W Fast Charging ◾ Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 AIE processor ◾ 6.35 inch HD+ IPS In-Cell Display ◾ Triple Slots for 2 Nano SIM and 1 SD Card ◾ Triple Back Camera - 13MP, 8MP, 2MP with Dual LED Flash ◾ 8MP Front Camera as a small notch in display ◾ 3/4 GB RAM, 32/64GB Storage ◾ Face Unlock and Fingerprint security sensors ------------------- 💎 DISPLAY ------------------- 》SCREEN: I liked this big 6.35"" IPS display. The bezels are quite thin and looks beautiful. 》RESOLUTION: Though the resolution is HD+ (720x1544 px)the display was quite decent to look and pictures did look very nice and it's almost near to an AMOLED display. 》VIEWING ANGLES: The corners were clean and the viewing angles were great. ------------------- 💪 BUILD ------------------- 》BUTTONS - The power and volume buttons are on the right hand side and only the SIM tray on the left - Though it's quite easy to reach the buttons I wish the volume buttons were on the left side. 》PORTS - There is a 3.5 headphone jack available, a Micro-USB port along with the speaker grill and microphone at the bottom. 》FINGERPRINT SENSOR - There is a fingerprint sensor at the back of the phone which is quite fast, responsive and accurateand the face unlock is very fast too in my opinion. 》BODY - The build seems to be quite sturdy and awesome flush build. Looks premium in my perspective. I bought the Thunder Black variant color which I liked better than the electric Blue variant has a gradient color look with brush metal or stripe type design. Thought the 5000mah battery makes it a bit heavy the weight balance of the phone is superb and I felt it well balanced in my hand. --------------------------------------------------------- 🖥️ PROCESSOR, RAM & STORAGE --------------------------------------------------------- 》PROCESSOR: The Qualcomm snapdragon 665 SoC is fast. Most games including PubG and Asphalt runs very smooth in medium settings and was able to run in high setting too but with slight frame drops. 》RAM: I bought the 3GB RAM which seems to be quite enough but the 4GB would provide better multitasking. It uses the LPDDR4x so with 3GB RAM itself I found it the app switching smooth. 》STORAGE: The 64GB storage has a Read and Write performance of around 250 MB/s which is very good. I was able to open apps faster and playing games was well optimized. ------------------- 🔋 BATTERY ------------------- 》The 5000mah massive battery can take me through almost 2 day of average usage. 》The battery can be charged by 18W fast charge which ------------------- 📷 CAMERA ------------------- 》REAR MAIN: The main camera is a 13MP, the pictures are natural in term of colors, no over saturation in outdoors. Indoor the camera did a pretty decent job too. For this price point the camera did a good job in my opinion but software post processing can be improved. 》REAR SECOND: The second camera is a 8MP Ultra-Wide which was good, though I feel post processing software could be improved. 》REAR THIRD: There is a third 2MP camera for the depth effect in Portraits. Though there is slight miss in some bokeh effects, it did a good job. 》FRONT: The front facing camera is 8MP and is in the display as a notch style, quite decent and has AI. -------------------------------------- 💡 OTHER FEATURES -------------------------------------- ፨ Comes with an Ultra Game Mode ፨ Android Pie (9) with Fun Touch OS ------------------------- 💖 WHAT I LIKED ------------------------- ◾ Big battery ◾ Decent triple camera setup ◾ Fast storage ◾ Fast charging ------------------------------------------------- ♻️ WHAT I FELT CAN BE IMPROVED ------------------------------------------------- ◾ Full HD+ display could have been used though current display is good ◾ Image post processing could have been improved. Gcam looks better than stock camera. ------------------- 🍱 OVERALL ------------------- I feel Vivo has finally heard customers and has come up with a good specs. The camera give natural lighting photos but many including me like more punchy colors post processing which is missing. Using third party camera were better in my perspective. The big battery and the fast charging is the most liked feature. Overall one of the excellent phones in Vivo Series and in this budget segment, considering the processor and all other specs it's a very good phone in my perspective but has room for improvement. 🥈","30 Sep 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Thunder Black Size name: 3GB+64GB","","Yes","Captain Retail","4.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Vivo just nailed it !!!","A few haters are there writing wrong reviews. Let me clear some doubts along with PUBGM. Display- Yes I agree the phone does not have a 1080p display but this is totally fine. The more the resolution is, the more it consumes battery. And HD+ IPS LED is fine at this price range. Camera- Triple rear camera 😚 with wide and ultra wide shots ... Slow Mo at 120fps .. AI supporting UI- Vivo's UI is what I really loves the most. No ads. Easy to understand it. Battery- 5000 with dual engine fast charging (9v 2a + 5v 2a) boosts your phone battery from 0 to 100 in less than 2 hours. And believe me, You are ready for the whole day with heavy usage. Protection- This maybe a concern as there is no C Gorilla Glass. But wait ... There is a glass which is just less than equivalent to CGG along with a screen protector. PUBGM- Most of you are here for this section only.😄 Just Kidding Works really fine with smooth and high. HD is not available but will be activated soon once tencent modifies the game for SD665. The game loads completely within 30-40 seconds which is good actually. I have covered almost everything.

"Not worth","It's my first Vivo phone(for my mother). I had been using Samsung earlier. And i think i have made a mistake by buying Vivo. Should have bought M10s or M30s instead. Samsung's software is way better than vivo's. M10s or M30s has got Amoled screen, dolby atmos, better camera, ufs2.1 and so many other things. U10 phone has 3 cameras, but are not good; speaker does provide clear sound; screen is mediocre; looks not good enough; bad software and many other below average things. I regret buying vivo.","04 Oct 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Electric Blue Size name: 3GB+32GB","","Yes","Pranjal Maini","2.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Extremely Disappointed","No value for money. Software is sloppy. Not enough features in phone, seems like using old phone. Camera is useless, Wide capture doesn't work properly, zooming is worst, however selfie is just OK nothing much. Phone heats up like microwave. Display is cool. OS is not upto the Mark. ViVo claims it's ""Funtouch OS"", but actually it's totally ""F*ed Up OS"". However the only good thing about phone is that it just looks good from outside, but under the hood it's totally Useless.

"Vivo U10 - A great budget phone","I recently purchased Vivo U10 3gb ram 64gb rom version. Available in electric blue and thunder black colors, I had opted for the latter. I got it at a price of Rs.9,990. The phone came with a 6.35 inch touchscreen display that offered a resolution of 720x1544 pixels along with an aspect ratio of 19:59. The clarity was pretty clear and gave the feel of a notepad or kindle as far as reading is concerned. It claimed to be powered by an octa-core Qualcomm snapdragon 655 processor, owing to which the functioning of the phone was pretty smooth, no hang issues (at least till now). The battery was 5,000mAH and supported fast charging. The phone can be used for 10-12 hours easily without charging. Coming to the camera, the rear packed a 13 mp primary camera, a second 8 mp camera and a third 2 mp camera. Owing to the auto focus setting that the rear camera setup featured, I did not have to worry much about adjusting settings while clicking pictures. The picture quality however was just average. White balance had to be adjusted to brighten up the pictures. The front camera was 8 mp. While the selfie quality in natural light was still fine, it doesn't satisfy much in internal light settings. Although there's a beauty mode for selfies, the pictures were not crystal clear using the feature. The flash pictures were also average. The card tray had two sim card slots and one slot for memory card which could be opened using the pin provided. The dual sim smart phone accepted only nano sim cards. The phone supported both fingerprint sensor and face unlock. While registering for the finger print, it takes more time than usual, requiring one to punch in 12-15 times to register completely. Connectivity options included bluetooth, wi-fi, gps, micro-usb,fm radio, 3g, 4g. The phone also had ambient light sensor right next to the front camera. The packaging was decent and came equipped with the phone, a transparent back cover and a charger. The earphone was missing(they don't give you that, so you need to shell out some extra money here ).I also downloaded several games and heavy apps to check the phone's performance. It operated smooth and had no issues what so ever. The phone is a bit heavy but the look and the feel takes over. Overall, the phone is pretty decent within this price range as far as the performance and appeal is concerned but could have been improved in terms of picture quality and weight.  It would also have been better if they gave a headphone with it.","30 Sep 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Thunder Black Size name: 3GB+64GB","","Yes","lavina","4.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"A good budget phone with top-end features","If you are looking for a budget phone, then Vivo U10 can be your ideal choice. It comes with an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor alongside 3gb RAM and supports two nano sim cards. There are two colour variants - Electric Blue and Thunder Black. Both looks amazing. The 6.35-inch display makes it more convenient for watching videos and speakers serve the purpose very well if you are sitting in a room. The phone lagged just once when I turned it on for the first time, otherwise it's going all smooth. The look and feel of the phone is great. It's gradient finish interested me particularly. Another thing that caught my attention is its back camera. The three cameras at the back panel including 13 MP primary sensor, 8 MP wide-angle lens and 2 MP depth sensor are great for taking pictures, especially in low light. The front camera didn't disappoint me too. However, the picture quality degraded considerably when the selfies were taken in dim light. Pros: Very smooth gaming. Did not lag during my 2 hours non-stop gaming The battery life is good. Lasted more than I expected. The large screen gives a better gaming experience. Its smooth slim finish gives it a sophisticated appearance Great PRICE RANGE, of course. Cons: The charging seemed a little slow than what I expected from a phone of this segment. The front camera was a little below the mark The weight of the phone can be a little bummer if you are not accustomed of using heavy-weight phones. What else do you get? Along with the phone, you get a sturdy, transparent back cover, a pin(to open the sim card tray) and a charger. Earphones, however, do not accompany the phone. All in all, it's a great option for those who are looking for every significant feature in a phone but do not want to spend a fortune.","30 Sep 2019","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Thunder Black Size name: 3GB+64GB","","Yes","Divyanshi sumrav","4.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Pros - Beautiful body, very attractive yet not so filmsy Battery - fast charging for such a huge battery under 10k is so great Sound - nothing big here but no less Cons This phone is best when you have less apps installed and less apps in background. Once you have more this one becomes sluggish. Every app takes a 1 to 2 second extra to open that makes you wonder if you touched it or not Camera is very average that details are so less. Do not expect good output even after post processing Bloatwares are loaded. Most of those vivo apps are unnecesaary and more slow. And u have to disable notification on every one of them. Searching application is very difficult. Say if I input gpay most mobs fetch result for google pay, and this one not making your life even difficult Youtube casting is a lil bit better. vlc casting makes this one hang quite a bit and if your display is off at that time you will have to spend a lot of time to wake it up using your fingerprint. Forget everything, the phone is slow even when u compare other models below. Period. Stay away from the phone, the hypes are just gimmick","13 Oct 2019","","","Yes","Vinsdeon","2.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"An average phone !!!!","I have been using this phone since March this year and I will have to say only positive thing about this phone is its battery life. Lets break it down into parts:- 1) Camera:- average camera with poor wide angle picture quality. Night mode is kinda okish. 2) Battery :- Awesome 3) Screen:- Above average. 4) Fingerprint reader:- Misses to read my finger 8/10 times. 5) AESTHETICS:- Though a finger magnet looks shrap in black. Ps:- If u play a lot of Battle royale games don't buy this product . Lags a lot and game crashes multiple times.","14 Jul 2020","Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers Colour: Thunder Black Size name: 3GB+32GB","","Yes","Siddharth S Singh","3.0","Vivo U10 (Electric Blue, 5000 mAH 18W Fast Charge Battery, 3GB RAM, 32GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-740/product-reviews/B07DJD1RTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Keep away from Amazon when it's Apple.","May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates). It was handed over to the Apple ASP as the return window closed on 10/10/19 (what use it was for??) and diagnosed as having issues and has further been sent to Apple repair facility at Bengaluru. So I'm here w/out my first iPhone after using it(suffering for??) just a little over 2 weeks and the CREDIT GOES TO AMAZON !! Bravo, keep it up Amazon.","20 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Purple","","Yes","Suman Biswas","1.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVMCLP7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"First Time iPhone User Review :-)","The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome. Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging. The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant). Cons: 1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears. 2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger. Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro). But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Sunny Kumar","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVMCLP7/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

"iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals","This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.","13 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Keshav Alur","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVMCLP7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi]. After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

"Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB","This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie.

"Trust In Amazon, INTACT !","First i would like to write about the Online Shopping Platform : AMAZON. Amazon is and i believe will be the best and the most trusted e-commerce brands in the country. Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there. But my answer would be, GO FOR IT. I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC. No doubts remain anymore. Well that being said, nothing is permanent. I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone. Keep it up. Good delivery, on time. Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight. I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints. Delivery: Good. Product Packaging: Very Good. Notifications: Good. Shopping Experience: Good. About the product, well you guys, know about it very well already. One stop shop for all my shopping needs. AMAZON is the way to go !","02 Aug 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Aakash Ashok Ojha","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVMCLP7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Best thing that money can buy","Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11. Go for it guys.

"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers.. Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years. Sound & Call Quality also Network Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent! Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection. Camera: The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P I would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!","02 Feb 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Jyotsna","3.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - White","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-White/product-reviews/B07XVMCLP7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The iPhone for everyone!","Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out. First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that. Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one. ✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry. ✅ All-day battery life. ✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance. ✅ Wireless charging ✅ An extra ultra-wide camera ✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now) ✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features. But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.

The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years. Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal. On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism. Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised. Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.

Superb Display 3.Design:3/5 It has a6000Mah battery,  still looking not bulky. No glass body,  but who cares after you put a back cover..  In my opinion, don't spend more money for glass body if you uses back covers 4. Camera: 3/5 Back camera pretty good but front camera's low light output is very low..  many features available such as slow and super slow videos available.. 5.

With 6gb ram,128 GB internal storage and Amoled display I am more than satisfied. I have been using Samsung phones from the start. Samsung's Amoled screen is what I am attracted to the most. The feel it gives is simply amazing. But battery dont seem to be a 6000 mah. As far as a non gamer is concerned this phone is the best under this price range.","13 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Nikhil","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"नाम बड़े और दर्शन छोटे ...","Even realme performs better.....few issues which concerned me after use were 1. When recording slow motion videos...there is always flicker on screen. 2. fingerprint sensor needs more than few attempts to work 3. Camera is better than realme but not as good as redmi 4. Battery survives one and half day......which is bad because till now I m using it only for WhatsApp and call......I wonder what will happen when I use it for gaming 5. Heats when i charge....not expected from a world class company phone 6. Mobile data connection vanishes many times in a day...I thought it was my airtel network .....but the same sim works on my old volte phone...without any issue.... Suggestions for people who have bought this phone..... Since company does not provides a screen guard..... Please add a screen guard as soon as possible.....because my phone got little scratches ....as I had kept my bike keys and phone in same pocket....I am repenting on not applying screen guard on my phone early... Suggestions for People who have not bought this phone..... If you are low on budget then only select this model ......otherwise go for some other model of Samsung or any other brand.....by adding few more bucks.... I am attaching two videos one in normal mode.....second in slow mode.....both videos are made by m21......you can see the flikr effect in second video easily..","19 May 2020","Size name: 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","unemployed","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The best phone money can buy at this price","I bought the Raven Black, 4GB-64GB variant of the Samsung Galaxy M21 for my mother. I'm impressed with the phone's overall usability. Since my mother is not a heavy user unlike me, I decided to go for Samsung by considering the brand value and overall specs of the phone. The main requirements for my mom are- Good display for media consumption, good battery life and a clean and easy to use UI without any unnecessary ads. Since the Galaxy M21 ticks all the right boxes I decided to go for this phone. Moreover my mother was using a Samsung Mobile prior to this and hence she was accustomed with the functionality of the UI. -The display of the phone is brilliant and at par with the Amoled display of my Redmi K20 Pro. -The battery life is also very good and it easily gives 1.5 days backup even under heavy usage. The only complain I have is the length of the charging cable which is very short. - The performance is good too for day to day usage. The Exynos 9511 is fairly capable and I haven't seen any stutter or lag in UI. If you are a hardcore gamer than I would recommend to look for alternative since it would not perform as good as its competition in regards to gaming. For casual gamers it will do the job well. -The cameras on this phone are brilliant with very good image processing done by Samsung. It takes pictures with natural colours. - The speaker output is average. Its loud enough but the sound produced is nothing impressive since it lacks bass and that clarity in the sound output. - The audio output via the 3.5mm Jack is very good as it supports Dolby Atmos. - The fingerprint sensor is very fast but the face unlock feature is not that consistent as it sometimes fails to read your face. Hence, overall it is a great value package from Samsung and I would highly recommend this phone to everyone looking for a good phone at this price point unless he/she is a heavy gamer. Thanks for reading. Update: After the Software update on 17 June the face unlock feature got extremely fast and accurate.😀","04 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Pranjal Sharma","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Super Slow Camera, Big Battery & Worst Backup, Huge Charging Time,  Poor Network Antenna","I am writing this review after one-week use of Samsung Galaxy M21. The only good point is amazing Samsung one UI 2.0 and sAMOLED display The issues I faced are 1. Super Slow Camera: It is taking 2-4 sec to capture the photo with 48 MP camera 2. Heating issue: Many time with normal using I observed some heating on the top of the backside 3. Poor Network Antenna: I was using MOTOROLA in the same area and receiving a better signal (latency few milliseconds) as compared to Galaxy M21 (Latency and signal strength are quite low in same ISP). 4. Big Battery but Worst Performance: Battery backup is not satisfactory and only a little better than 3400 mAh with Snapdragon SoC based phone. Additionally, it is taking a huge amount of time for charging. Among all these issues I believe it is an average deal under 13k","18 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Bahadur Sk","3.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The speaker is not the best, sometimes when I put on loud speaker the person I am speaking to will complain they cannot hear me. Plus when I play music the sound is not the best. Also, the phone does not come with original earphones so you have to hustle for that.

"Yeah...it's best in this budget...","There are some strong point which will force you to buy this phone. 1. One UI 2.0 - I would say Samsung's UI is the best experience you can ever feel in any budget phone. This is the strongest point which no youtuber will tell you ever. 2. Screen - none other brand offers this quality of screen in their phone of same budget. A user's first priority is screen because 24/7 he/she just need to see on the screen, no metter whatever thing is he using in his phone. Camera- daylight shots are amazing as all the Samsung's phone do. Color contrast is and image processing is better then redmi note 9 pro and realme 6 which is rs1300 more. but night shots are not as good as other brands give. Battery- after 2hrs pubg and regular social media usage you can enjoy this phone from morning 7am to evening 12pm. Charging speed is very slow. It took 2hrs and 30 mins to fully charge. Performance- No doubt Exynos 9611 is not as good as sd720g or helioG90t. But in daily task you will not face any lag on this phone. For pubg gamer-you will notice lag in high resolution gaming but if you want to play without lag then obviously you have to play in Smooth+Ultra it will give you a best performance without any issue.","20 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","Abhishek Sarkar","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Don't believe in 5 🌟 reviews","This is an overhyped phone. Don't believe in all the 5 🌟 reviews . 1st battery is ordinary - It doesn't work like 6000mah. In 14hrs it came from 100% to 25% ( screen on time 4.5hrs, few calls, WhatsApp, one movie and some Facebook) which is almost same as my previous phone with 3500mah battery. 2. Phone heats up  even on light browsing in firefox 3. Network reception is very poor, I used to get full signal in my previous realms phone where as in this it's two bar less all the time ( even when I go to terrace. And call quality is average 4. There is no network speed or data consumed in a day. ( This cannot be called as smartphone when it doesn't have these basic features) 5. Adaptive brightness doesn't work most of the time. 6. Camera, both front and back is pretty good. Best part is it doesn't smoothens the skin. 7. I don't play games so can comment on how it process heavy games, but for me all apps functions like breeze. 8.Only thing I like is display which is really good as black colour is really black on this display and audio through headphone is nice Edit: changed my rating from 2 start to 1 star ( infact no star). This phone is totally unusable it heats up like anything, you can't keep the phone on your ears it gets so hot. Both Amazon and samsung are cheating their customers by giving substandard products and not accepting returns too. Edit: Samsung is giving level headset free for good reviews. So don't believe the positive review. I reassure this phone is an iron box.. gets so hot even when I'm not using, hot even when it's in pocket. One more bug is you cannot use dual 4g volte, second sim has to be in 2g to get stable 4G in first sim..","02 Jun 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Sandeep","1.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Never buy electronics from Amazon..Feeling cheated by Samsung and Amazon","1. I bought this to gift it to my dear one but I am shocked to see the camera quality of this phone is like 1 mb. I tried all the modes but it enhances the photo brightness automatically and and the photo becomes like a cartoon. 2. Tried installing other camera apps but still the quality is poor. 3. Tried options for returning but found that there is no option for that. 4.

"Really a monster of a phone at this cost","At this cost, the phone looks premium. For folks who like a premium looking phone not the fancy looking phone, this is the best at this price segment. all other products at this price bracket consist of fancy and decorated back which may not be the cup of tea for a section of people for whom simple and plain is the premium. Monster battery, One of the best display at this price segment, great finger print sensor, decent camera etc.. If you are a non gamer, go for it... Only problem i faced is delay in delivery (almost 10 days).","14 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","VAIBHAV","5.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Samsung phones have signal strength issues","I have previously purchased m30s but the the signal strength was very weak so I had to to sell the phone on OLX . Apart from the signal strength the phone was awesome I had used Nokia 1 and the internet was superfast by using the same sim card. I suppose Samsung reduces the signal strength in order to reduce the SAR rating. I understand that SAR rating is harmful to our body and brain but Nokia is far excellent in terms of signal strength. Samsung phones are excellent in terms of providing good specifications in budget. Now coming to this phone camera is good, touch responsiveness is excellent, it is having Wi-Fi calling which was not mentioned on the comparison websites such has 91Mobiles neither on the specifications on any otyer website. So M21 is having all the features as comparison to m30s. M21 is having Gorilla Glass which m30s lacks M21 is having Android 10 version As compared to Android 9 of m30s but m30s can be upgraded to Android 10, 11 This phone lacks NFC which is present in A30s  A50s Battery is 6000 mah but Nokia phones having the same processor, screen size with 3500 MH batteries are running the same duration as this phone. So 6000 image battery is just a marketing gimmick. Charging even using the type C fast charger takes up to 4 hours for full charge. Battery lasts for one day after heavy usage. Pros: Super amoled screen 6000 MaH battery Cons: Signal strength is very poor. (You will have to wait for almost a year to download an app) Since I watch internet TV so I rely on the hotspot (signal strength) in order to buffer the web series movies etc","22 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Blue","","Yes","Pankaj","2.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

The camera quality and battery life are excellent. Fingerprint reader is very fast.  Elegant design and wonderful display. The user interface is also very good.

It's good but not like 6000mah at all.Also charging is really slow. 2.It's SAmoled screen is best in this price range. 3. Processor is not very powerful,I have noticed some occasional lags. 4.Heating issue detected in front camera areas It's not like overheat or something but it is hot. 5.Os is good but there is no network speed meter function present natively. 6.FB app is keep refreshing it's feed when I minimize and open the app again after some time. 7.Sometimes app crashes without any reason. 8.The phone is heavy not too heavy but you can easily notice it after some day's of usage. 9.At 12699 price I don't think there is any other phone is as good as this is,atleast for now. 10.It doesn't have Good lock and native screen recorder present in OS neither you can sideload them.This is unfair I think.","19 May 2020","Size name: 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage Colour: Black","","Yes","AnJan","4.0","Samsung Galaxy M21 (Midnight Blue, 4GB RAM, 64GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-614/product-reviews/B07HGJJ559/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But now I feel that I was wrong. A day almost 10 to 20 percentage battery drain. (Only finish). One of the main problem I face is the search button for contacts. It is placed in a corner and that too very small. And if I search a contact. After few days if I open contacts again, what I searched will still remain there.

It is handy n slim at the same time. 👉Pictures and different language  support in text and typos is a welcome feature. 👉Overalll worth it at 7950 Rs.

"Great device to have...","I have been using this phone for 10 days now. It's a total worth for the price. I got it in a exchnage with extra 3,000 offer on exchange. Talking about the device, the screen is emersive and bright, love to watch videos on this device. Cameras are superb. Performence is undoubtedly superb. Battery life is good too, if you don't play PUBG, u will going to get a day life easily or probably more. The phone is bit on the heavier side.

"Best device under 25000","Display: I just fall in love with this phone's amoled screen.  I use my phone mostly for watching videos on youtube and binge watching on Amazon prime so I'm really happy with this phone's display. Viewing angles and deeper blacks in the display are amazing. If you a movie lover you willl fall in love with this phone. Apart from this the display is buttery smooth and responsive. 60hz display is still good as it consumes less battery. If you haven't used 90hz display is past then you won't gonna miss anything. Performance: It's a beast when it comes to day to day usage. Ram management is great. There's no lag at all. Thanks to the UFS 2.0 storage, the app opening time is very less. The phone boot time is very less and can opened in just few seconds. Gaming performance is great there's no lag at all. You will love playing heavy games Asphalt 9, Call of duty and pubg on it. Phone's has all the sensors in it and picking up all the right spots. Processor is 855 Snapdragon which is the flagship and it won't disappoint you. Battery life: I'm a power user so my phone's battery last for about 6-7 hours which is great. If you are a moderate user you can easily use it for about 1 day easily. There's a bit drop in battery performance with MIUI11.0.3 update but it has improved the overall Performance significantly and to be honest the drop is marginal about 4-5%. I wasn't that impressed with the fast charging via 18 watt charger supplied by Xiaomi with the phone. It takes around 1 hours 35 or 40 mins in fully charging the phone. Though the phone supports 27 watt fast charging and if a 27watt fast charger is used the battery can be charged in around 1 hour 15 mins or 20 mins. Moreove with that charger you can charger around 55% of your battery in just 30 mins. So it would be great if that charger was provided by Xiaomi. But keeping in mind the low cost of the phone it's still a great deal. Moreover, you can buy that 27 watt charger from mi store for just 1000 rs so my suggestion is to go for that charger and use the full potential of your phone. Camera: I'm really impressed with rear camera of this phone. I have compared it with my friend's realme X2 pro phone and this phone is handsomely beating the rear camera of realme X2 pro. The only area where this camera needs improvement is night photography. Though selfie camera wasn't that great. I still think Xiaomi can improve the performance of front camera with a software update. Considering the great potrait shots, wide angle shots and zommed in shots captured by this phone i will give it 8/10. If i have to rate the rear camera only i will give it a 10/10 as this phone is a beast in daylight photography and can easily beat the few high-end expensive phones. OS: I wasn't a big fan of MIUI but now the OS has improved significantly. This phone is running on latest android 10 with MIUI 11. I'm not seeing any ads in MIUI 11 which is great and this OS is highly customisable so I'm gonna give it a 9/10. I have deducted 1 star for few bloatware apps that can't be removed from the phone. But overall the MIUI 11 is smooth and gives you a tons of features which is really cool. Call quality, network reception and wifi speed: I have to say that the network reception is excellent in this device which is the most important thing for me. The network reception in my house is prettty bad and most of the phone's failed in network connectivity but this one is a beast. It has a great network reception and the call quality of the the phone is just outstanding. The wifi speed you get in this device is unmatched and i am just loving it. Audio quality: The audio quality of this phone is great you can listen to Hi Resolution audio songs with ease if you use a earphone that supports high resolution. I'm really happy with the audio quality and it is one of the best. Speaker volume is loud and clear. It has a single bottom firing speaker but it's not gonna disappoint you. I will give it a 10/10 in audio section. So lets look at the overall ratings: Display : 10/10 Battery performance: 10/10 Fast charging: 8/10 Ram management: 10/10 Booting time : 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Network reception: 10/10 Call quality: 10/10 Wifi speed: 10/10 Rear camera: 10/10 Selfie camera: 7/10 Video recording 8.5/10 Audio quality: 10/10 It's a value for money phone and I'm gonna give it a 10/10 in value for money section. I recommend you to go for 128 gb storgage and 6 gb ram variant as it will give you more value for money. The cost of 128 gb/6gb varient is 25000 and in deals you can easily get it at around 24000. Moreover, if you exchange an older cheap handset with this one you can significantly reduce the overall cost. I have exchanged my old device and bought this one for 18148 rs. So just go for it.","02 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Mandeep","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Value for money Flagship, Just go for it.","Camera performance is okay, Battery is okay. Superfast processor for gamers. Full view display with Pop-up front Cam is what I like. Super Amoled display, 4000mAh battery with 27W fast charging support is just amazing.  Fingerprint reader is not up to the mark. Don't try Face unlock. I have been using it since last 1 month, no problems till now. I got it at Rs. 23000/- with SBI card offer and with 6 months No Cost EMI. At this price its best in the market. Edit 1- Regarding battery performance, it's getting better with updates. Edit 2- After 6 months, I can say it was amazing deal at that time. Now GST has increased from 12% to 18%, so the prices are gone up. I have received MIUI 12 update and user experience just got amazing. It's full view Super Amoled display with Snapdragon 855.

"Worst Product Quality","This phone can be a good hardware however there are few serious issues related to internet connection.. JIO and IDEA 4G not supported and does not work properly, even my previous 4 yrs old mobile has better speed. There are few solutions given over internet suggesting changes to APN etc. however that was not required to any other ordinary phones.. and those solutions do not work. Secondly MI is forcing users to use their browser over google chrome ( as they acknowledge the issue but don't care to resolve) which can be security threat.

"Awesome phone at such a cheap price","I only write reviews when I genuinely feel something is worth it. This phone is superb at this price range. **********Pros********** * Processor : Qualcomm SM8150 Snapdragon 855 (7 nm) : Do I need to say anything about this processor. * Battery Capacity 4000mAh : Battery is amazing. It lasts really long with gaming and otherwise. * AMOLED capacitive touchscreen : The screen display is outstanding. * Corning Gorilla Glass 5 : This really protects against any scratches on the phone display but it is always better to buy a screen guard. * FIngerprint sensor: This works like a charm. It is on screen since it is an Amoled display. * Call quality: Loud and clear * Design: Very attractive * Fast charging : Quick Charge 4.0 - It charges the phone really fast, personal experience. The fastest charging title, comparing all the phones goes to Realme X2 Pro I guess (as of now). Cons * No expandable storage : For me 128 GB is more than enough * Pop-up camera for unlocking the phone: For me no issue since I don't use this feature. For many it might be * Camera can be made better: It is good but can be better. Come on, at this price what more do you want. Overall performance: 10/10 Battery life: 10/10 Display: 10/10 Design: 10/10 Camera: 8/10 Software: 8/10 since I like iOS better than any Android version. If you are buying this phone for superb gaming experience and day to day usage then go for it.

"Great camera, Amazing Builb quality, poor selfie cam","The phone is surely a winner. The camera is the main highlight. It sure is the best camera Redmi has produced . The main primary camera is really nice. The images are vibrant ane has a lot of depth. The Bokeh shots and portrait shots are really nice. The wide angle shots aren't the best though. But the selfie camera is a huge let down. The same crappy redmi camera. The built quality is par excellence, the fit and feel is top notch. The glass body and metal is really nice and we'll built. The display is a bliss to look at. The full display is dream come true. Although the Redmi ui is not the first go to option it grows on you and adding a theme or skin makes it better. The battery backup is good and the quick charging is a saver ! Fingerprint reader is fast as I can tell.

"Does the job","Writing a review after 2 days of usage: Initial feel and look are quite premium, the back is glossy and in hand feel is that of a premium smartphone. Usage and installation is pretty smooth, Snapdragon 855 is bang on the buck, processor is extremely fast, with no lag whatsoever, even after opening 5-6 apps at the same time. Camera quality is pretty average, did not find any pixelation but the color sharpness and contrast are not that great as 1 would expect, selfie camera beautification feature is something i do not like, makes you look overly animated. Battery life is not good, for 4000 mah i expected it to last atleast an entire day without charging, but somehow it disappoints in that area (my usage is very heavy though) 128gb is sufficient initially, but no expandable slot makes me worry that i might have to manage the data i keep on my phone and might have to move some to an external source later down the line. Gameplay is extremely smooth with no lag and touch sensitivity is flawless. Fingerprint reader is pretty efficient and will get it right 9/10 times, might have to delete old prints and re-do them if you install a temper glass. Overall a decent option at this price-range","09 Jan 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Charanpreet sehgal","3.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Brilliant for the price","Ridiculous specs for the money you're paying. A processor same as Samsung Note 10 / OnePlus 7 Pro / or equivalent to iPhone X series. Great sets of cameras, which can be further improved upon by porting Google Camera. Quite decent battery. Frankly, the only negative could be the untested durability that I can only find out about after using the phone for a few years. Everything else is good, or if not has workarounds (like MIUI if you don't like it). Just an overall amazing package.

"Wish to replace the device, facing issues with performance of the device","I purchased the 6 gb variant and the phone was delivered on 21st March, 2020 and since then I've been facing some issues with the device. First: The device has a really heavy UI that consumes 50% of the Ram... I bought a flagship device for smooth functioning and this device doesn't seem to deliver the same. Second: Almost everyday the screen goes blank while I'm using it and no matter how much I wait it doesn't light back up, I only see the fingerprint blinking and I need to restart it to get back the device to start functioning again. Third: While I'm typing a message or even this review, it suddenly shuts the app and take me to the home screen and then I've to open the app from the recent apps to get back to the work I'm doing. Fourth: I wish to replace the device but Amazon only gives me the option to return it... If I return it how will I get the device I exchanged it with..? Also since we are having a nation wide lockdown these days how am I supposed to return/replace the device within the set time limit...?

"A better option is available, ALWAYS!","Xiaomi K20 pro is undoubtedly a good phone. Here are a few of Pros and cons, I could share after around 4 months of usage. Pros: - Camera (IMX586 sensor) - Bright AMOLED panel - SD855 processor - Good Battery life (lasts around 10-12 hrs for me with 100% data on, web browsing, social medias browsing, 1-1.30 hrs of 4G calls) - Last but no least : Head Phone jack and Notification Light Cons : - Higher refresh rate (90, 120, 144 hz) panels available in market with Flagship phones. - Touch sampling refresh rate could have been improved. - Worst UI : ads popping out of nowhere in every app. Xiaomi need to stop selling ads for flagship level phones. If someone spending this much on a phone and still ads are popping of nowhere, this is very irritating. - Upgraded/overclocked version of 855 could have been used instead. Though the phone is good, you get good clicks from Sony's IMX586 (a flagship sensor of its time). Battery life is average. Phones looks average to me. Verdict : Realme X2 pro could have been considered, would have to compromise with camera but HDR and 90 hz panel would be available. Along side, for a good UI OnePlus 7T would always be a good choice, if headphone jack is not a priority. Again, being Indian, this would be my last Chinese owned company's phone/gadget. Have used Samsung's Note 2, S4, S7 Edge, and S8. Now, would again go back for Samsung's phones for better hardware quality and best in class UI.","12 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Flame Red","","Yes","Harbhajan Singh","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"The true flagship killer.","This was without a doubt the true flagship killer. And even a year after its release, Snapdragon 855 beats all the new generation mid-tier processors by a huge margin. This is quite interesting considering the fact that a lot of your mid-tier phones are now more expensive than the K20 pro. This phone truly has it all - a beautiful AMOLED display, sliding cameras that seem to be pretty well built and sturdy, all the important cameras that you'll actually need at the back (main camera, zoom and ultra wide). The phone looks amazing, feels amazing and works perfectly. If I have to nitpick what I don't like about it, it would be the size (a prefer smaller phones, though this is still smaller than similar phones), the slower fingerprint reader (which wasn't too much of an issue for me at least) and maybe it would be cooler with a 90hz screen (which seems more like a bonus than a necessity).","11 Jun 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Areeb","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"FLAGSHIP KILLER","Pros : Amoled display is wonderful and giving me great experience I switched from Vivo V5s So I'm really excited and satisfed about this Battery life: Yes battery life is pretty decent for a pubg match in Full HD mode drains about 7-8 percent of battery sometimes 10 Processor: it's a flagship killer and no need to talk about this at all. It's awesome 3.5mm jack Pop up camera is also fast and its light and music sounds cool Notification light on pop up is top-notch Fingerprint: personally I didn't  like in display sensor it's accurate but finger need be placed in some exact position but it's fast Camera and vedio: though it's triple camera still its a big hit camera is awesome no doubt about this Design: it's of pure glass and protected by Gorilla glass 5 design is mind blowing Cons: heating issues,normally phone never raises it's temperature but if you play games after playing you can make dosas on phone graphite cooling they have mentioned but I didn't find it working FAST CHARGING: It's not that fast coz it's just 18W takes 1+ hr to charge completely but k20pro supports 27W if you buy the charger paying 999 it could be even more faster MIUI : sometimes os gets you into trouble you need to click on same tab or screen twice still dosent work but can be solved by software update Price is high and its not con beacuse this  mobile is combination of Snapdragon 855 also comes with amoled display so price will be 25 itself One thing is I brought it after 1 year of its release and still I'm satisfied I got it for 25,499","02 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Vamshi Deekshith","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Costly in today's market","Writing this review after almost 10 days of usage. Let me write the Pros and Cons. PROS: Battery life: Decent battery life. But I compeltely discharged and 100% charged the phone twice after getting it. Since then operating it in the 30-90% range. The 18 watt charger does a decent job in charging it till 90% after which I dont charge it further. Camera: Decent quality camera. Better than my wife's Samsung M30. But dont expect flagship level pics. Its impressive, not excellent. Processor: Snapdragon 855 is a benchmark itself. However I am not a gamer. Still a good processor along with Amoled screen helps to get a better battery life. Display: Very natural display that you expect from an Amoled screen. Better than Samsung M30 again. Style: If looks could kill. 10/10 for the style. Just love it. Os: Had some bloatware. Removed it quickly. Not getting much Ads too. Now the updated MIUI 11 works like a charm. Call quality: Has a decent call quality which is absent in mid range MI phones. Loudspeaker: The mono speaker does a great job too. CONS: 1) Screen response: The screen is not smooth which you expect from a phone in this price range. No 90Hz display too. 2) Finger print sensor: The on screen fingerprint sensor is pathetic. Does not work most of the time. Conclusion: You get what you pay for. Its 10K cheaper than the 1plus 7t. And the quality is compromised according to the price as well. But it has a 855 processor which you wont get in below 20k phones. And the Amoled screen is not wonderful. One plus has a much better display. So you may consider other phones in this range like the newly launched Realme X3 etc.","10 Jul 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Glacier Blue","","Yes","Suryendu Das","4.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"Over All 5*","What I like is firstly the speed of SD 855. The feel in hand and display is really good. For 🤳 in good light the pictures could match with the best. For rear pictures though the quality is good in poor light I don't know for sure. Also I need to understand it better however I am not to deep into pictures and primarily for work it is amazing the speed and smooth interfacing. Battery life is quite ok too,been using it.for over 3 months Finger print reader works but staggers around and there is just one speaker at the bottom. Also MI pushes a lot of their own stuff like at every opportunity it directs you to MI browser instead of the Google Chrome, beware ofnthat as a lotta unnecessary stuff just latches on to the device.","26 Feb 2020","Size name: 128GB Colour: Carbon Black","","Yes","Shishir D.","5.0","Redmi K20 Pro (Carbon Black, 6GB RAM, 128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Redmi-K20-Pro-Carbon-Storage/product-reviews/B082FP7T27/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Great phone.... for basic use","Superb battery backup, till now no hanging issue noticed. Very good mobile for the basic users. Camera quality is average and u can see noise in the picture taken. Finger print sensor & facial recognition works well even with mask on. No issues with the mobile network & 4G data connectivity, data reception is very good. But WIFI part works slow with 75 to 90 mbps line showing on other handsets & laptop, this mobile will show only 10 to 11 mbps max.

"Keep away from Amazon when it's Apple.","May be my first negative review about the product & Amazon both. I was much elated to receive the iPhone 11 so fast, next day of dispatch i.e. 28/09/19, but the thing I got started heating up every now and then. Contacted Applecare, just to be consoled that it's quite normal. As it continued, tried to return the product by speaking to Amazon customer support but in vain. Some body called me back to convey that only Apple will decide which one to take back. Why is then Amazon took up the sacred duty of selling such an item which they can't exchange/ have no control ? The product developed new issues like proximity sensor malfunction and last but most importantly loosing mobile network every other minute(even had two software updates).

"First Time iPhone User Review :-)","The iPhone design is good and the camera quality is awesome. You can also take pictures in wide angles and the image quality is awesome. Phone got delivered at 9am on 28th September (I pre-order it on 27th September at 3am in the morning), I got my phone before the delivery date with nice and secured packaging. The overall look of the phone is premium and face unlocking is fast. I grabbed this phone with HDFC 6K Instant Discount Offer at Just 64K (128 GB Variant). Cons: 1. The phone is great but if you use ""in the box"" accessories like ""EarPods with Lighting Connector"", then you might feel a little pain in your ears. 2. The phone comes with 5W charger which charge your phone slowly. I recommend you to prefer using 18W charger. Well, I've never tried the iPhone before and I'm using this for the first time (Yes, I'm already using other apple products like MacBook Air & Pro). But the product is great and I'm just lovin it.","29 Sep 2019","Size name: 128 GB Colour: White","","Yes","Sunny Kumar","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Purple","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Purple/product-reviews/B07XVL4P83/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

But the amazon customer care told me that they need a job card and report from apple service center. The nearest service center is located at 210km from my place, imagine the amount of strain and how much its going to cost.

"iPhone XR with better Camera and Internals","This being my second Apple device. No, I haven't sold my kidney as I got this for about 58K. I have been an avid Android Fanboy using 1+ as my daily driver for the past 5 years. The switch using move to iOS and the entire transition using Drive, Photos etc.. It has been seamless. I may miss a thing or two about 1+ with what a stock Android would offer. Couple of my colleagues argued how good the latest 1+ phones are. Two things that 1+ will never be good at. Photography and Intermittent lag. Yes, a phone with 12 Gigs of ram lags! Now, off to the device. Pros The device's build quality is amazing. The detail given in to every tiny little thing should be noted. Even the Sim tray is made out of metal. Speakers sound better than my previous phone. A couple of you might argue about LCD with lower resolution on the device. I certainly cannot differentiate that though. Color blind maybe! OS - There's no other mobile OS that is this speedy, updated on time basis and supports device for 5 long years. Yeah, you can root your phone and rock new Lineage OS on your Droid but the circumstances of rooting, Magisk cannot help Banking apps work. Camera - There are no other camera phones that are this good. Night mode is amazing. Such low light pictures turn out be so good. Note Huawei phones no longer have Google services yes you can sideload Play Store but that's still pain the arse. Next Pixel isn't going to be cheap either. Cons Remember an iPhone is always treated as an asset than a phone. Ask someone who has dropped his or her phone on a hard surface and the pain that it takes to have it repaired or replaced. Couple of them have pointed out that the device is a bit thick. Yes it is. Honestly slim phones cannot have more juice within. You have to sacrifice either of them. No 3.5MM means you can't charge and listen to music i.e. move on to wireless headphones. Overall an amazing phone that's worth every penny. And a phone that I'd be using for the next 5 years for sure just like my 1+ One The Legend. Electronic goods are always depreciating unlike Gold or Land and fits the needs of checking messages and making calls is all you need.","13 Oct 2019","Size name: 64 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Keshav Alur","5.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Purple","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Purple/product-reviews/B07XVL4P83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

I observed back panel heating up issue especially while taking photos and using maps. [No, I have not put any additional back panels fyi]. After spending 60K+ and seeing this kind of heating issue is completely unacceptable from a brand like Apple. I have approached Apple care [Service Request No: SKC4616] and they said they have to send the device to Bangalore  for further diagnosis. When I called just before writing this review, they are quoting they are not working today due to Sunday they are closed and blah blah...Apple wake up.

"Terrific purchase: iPhone 11 White 128GB","This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android. I bet you will never go back to android after using IOS. Now I want to share my 2 month experience with iPhone 11. 1) Battery backup is 19 hours as I used it for 1 week. 2) Mind blowing Camera. Best is slow motion. 3) Very Handy. And look premium. If you have huge money then please go for Pro max. 4) Display is more or less good. Worth it because it is not Premium display and you are not paying for 11 Pro max. 5) You will love the sound when your phone is ringing. 6) Front camera is awesome and must try slow motion selfie. That's it.

Speculations and scepticism about whether or not, you should buy electronics from Amazon, will always be there. But my answer would be, GO FOR IT. I did buy this product from Amazon and it is AUTHENTIC. No doubts remain anymore. Well that being said, nothing is permanent. I TRUST IN AMAZON, when i think about buying anything from Apples to Apple Iphone. Keep it up. Good delivery, on time. Amidst the lockdown wave, starting 13th July, Midnight. I got it on the morning of 13th. So no complaints. Delivery: Good. Product Packaging: Very Good. Notifications: Good. Shopping Experience: Good.

"Best thing that money can buy","Dont go by the negative reviews! If you want to go for iphone which can compete with high end android phones, this is the one. I have used the Oneplus 7T for 2.5 months (and sold it) and can say after comparison that the photos that iPhone 11 takes are way better than OP 7T. The battery has been performing really well after all daily chores, youtube, spotify, netflix, etc. I have last charged the phone to 100% at 9.12 pm and as I write this review (12.54 pm next day), I have got 30% left. I used to have an iphone 6s which I used for 4 years after which I bought the OP 7T. Now that I am back to the ios ecosystem, it does feel good! Also, trust me, the transition back to a Liquid Retina display from 90Hz does not feel bad, because Apple has really done a good job is maintaining a crisp and vibrant display in iPhone 11.

"The best you can get!","It’s just beautiful. The iOS is so fluid and smooth. No lags whatsoever. Camera takes awesome pics. The best part is the battery. It easily lasts 1 day and maybe more with fairly intensive use. I am moving from Android to IOS and I already know that I am never ever going back to Android again. The phone feels solid and sturdy in the hand. I don’t have any negatives to write about even though I really thought about writing some because a review is never fair without writing pros and cons.

"Yes, it’s a Good iPhone!","The Battery cannot hold up for long, also let me point the very obvious 18W charger getting a miss from the box and still isn’t up to the current Unix-Linux run, Google Android OS phones like Samsung’s A 30’s which cost about 12-15k come with 15W chargers.. Camera: Night Mode is only useful if there is some kind of light it just can’t help but over expose the pictures and make them fee like they are from a Feature phone in the early years. Sound & Call Quality also Network Sound is spot on both the music and audio or video calls are crystal clear.. I must add the front firing speaker was a great addition but what will make it more interesting will be if they can make the other vent for just acoustics into a speaker and have three instead of a dummy vent! Network with any kind of case on will have issues of poor and unstable connection. Camera: The Live Photo’s with the new hardware module just works superb with decent lighting. It wouldn’t take you more than a couple of seconds to figure out what should be your frame with the sensor throughly doing its job picking up subjects, colors, shadows and adding the Apple magic in every photo :P I would’ve preferred an Apple insurance or any warranty extension, we are all aware how the exchange and sale value on these phones are like lately!","02 Feb 2020","Size name: 128 GB Colour: Black","","Yes","Jyotsna","3.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Purple","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Purple/product-reviews/B07XVL4P83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_5?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=5&reviewerType=all_reviews"

On downside, this phone is heavy as brick. Compared to similarly sized s10... this is too heavy.  Single hand use easily tired fingers and hand. Pictures are great but the wide angle is not good on people as it distorts edges in pictures. Speaker sound is also slightly mutted. Face id fails occasionally.

"Unbiased Review after 1 month of Usage","Battery Life- Can't Complain much on this, pretty decent, but the 5 W charger needs to be changed big time Camera- Video quality is the best in any smartphone, but wide angle night mode needs to be considered, picture quality is very very good, I just think that at times the pictures are a but Orangish for indian Skin tones....just my opinion to be honest Sound Quality- Very crisp and clear, may not be the loudest but clarity is top notch Processor- The best Screen Quality- I found it okay, don't keep your expectations too high, it does a great job for a LCD Value for Money- For an iphone, it is definitely a value for money, just get it if you don't have money to spare for the pro models, but if your main motive isn't camera and you don't have any interest to incease your apple ecosystem, then go for other Samsung Note 10 plus or OP 7t pro","31 Dec 2019","","","Yes","Abhishek Mohanty","4.0","Apple iPhone 11 (64GB) - Purple","https://www.amazon.in/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Purple/product-reviews/B07XVL4P83/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_6?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=6&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"The iPhone for everyone!","Alright, this review is going to be a little long so hear me out. First things first. Delivery was on time and the seller provided us with a genuine product. So thumbs up 👍  for that. Let me talk a little about the phone 📱. Out of all its siblings, this was one is the most reasonable one. ✅ It has the A13 Bionic processor meaning it is one of the best in the smartphone industry. ✅ All-day battery life. ✅ A great degree of water & dust resistance. ✅ Wireless charging ✅ An extra ultra-wide camera ✅ An extra SIM via eSIM (Only Jio & Airtel provide this for now) ✅ The excellent iOS support that is guaranteed for years to come so you never miss out on the new and exciting software features. But confused about getting the iPhone 11 Pro and Max version? Well, you will be paying a lot more for the AMOLED screen and the extra lens camera. Otherwise, the phones are nearly identical.

"Best in class","I switched from a realme1 to this phone so obviously i was blown away. The animations are so smooth,phone has premium feel, and its something u feel like u can carry around for the next 5 years. Playing games is on a whole other level on this phone , u can play with The max setting on pubg and 1 game would draw a max of 15-20 percentage. This isnt bad as pubg is a demanding game and running it on max setting is a very good deal. On the privacy side also apple is remarkable with its face id and permission mechanism. Every app is also 100x better than its counterpart in android as its very well optimised. Really awesome phone and i highly recommend if u want a phone urgently.or u can wait till iphone 12 :D.

"NOKIA vs SAMSUNG. Which one is best to buy.","Still Nokia is struggling to give a best feature phone to it's hand picked customer,after purchasing this phone I have used this phone last 7 days but I feel some more improvement need too.Its earpiece microfone voice not great at all it should be more Cristal clear like Samsung guru music 2. I think HMD global should be use the Samsung feature phone then sale your Nokia feature phone.Finally according to the feature phone segment SAMSUNG will be one step ahead than NOKIA , because Samsung feature phone battery,during call the voice clarity,and ringtone quality is far better than NOKIA, It's my challenge to all NOKIA lovers.

"Lost race with battery life and performance.","Talk about reliable product first name comes in mobile industry is Nokia, hence I bought Nokia 105 2019 model with dual sim which is not so value for money device. A basic phone which does not have camera, can store upto 1000 contacts and 500 sms.l and prized at ₹1100 It's been more than a month since i have purchased Nokia 105 2019, and to my surprise the only thing disappointed me is battery life. I expected it to outrun my iPhone but the battery lasts for only 2 days or max 3 days. Nokia 105 have battery drainage issue with when there is low signal reception. In the images you can see battery has come to half point. It was charged in the evening of Nov 25, 2019 and on Nov 26, 2019 at 2 pm IST battery is half dead. Nokia shoud bring down value to ₹700 - ₹800 as it does not even provide basic earphone with it now, which earlier were available in packaging with all handset. Regulated movement what's that...? Amazon asking for such thing is a big surprise to me. Top of this Nokia installed games which are as useless as their content is. Apart from Snake Xenia you won't be able to play any game unless you purchase and install them. Giving 2 stars as the performance expected from Nokia with this feature phone is not that par compared to competition.","26 Nov 2019","Colour: Black","","Yes","Nikhil S","2.0","NOKIA 105 2019 (Dual SIM, Black)","https://www.amazon.in/NOKIA-105-2019-Dual-Black/product-reviews/B07WXW8V4X/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

When I called support, the man was almost rude when he said you should call support before purchasing if you’re not sure. Like what - how would i even think of such a possibility in today’s world? Online shopping is supposed to be smooth and having to call support to check such essential stuff that is ABSENT from the description is just a slap in the face of e-commerce.

This is totally worth the money I spent and carries the same authentic feel and connection like the old Nokia did. There are something that did catch my eye. 1- The battery sometimes acts out differently. Sometimes one charge lasts 3-5 days and sometimes it is drained in a day. 2- The built quality is awesome bt there are times when the sim insertion and removal becomes a battle of it's own due to the solid packing of sim slots. 3- The charging port is a little too tight and there have been times when it felt likeni pulled a circuit or two while I was trying to remove the charger. ( You know the feel ? Right ? ) 4- The snake game does look nice but I think the keys being more soft than the earlier models make it a little hard to enjoy. These might have been just my experience but it was worth sharing. All in all in my personal opinion I'd say that phone does pack a punch and could totally be used as a primary cell phone if you please.

"Good phone for a retreat from android world","It's a phone that you can take with yourself while taking a break from the world. It's very cheap, handy, good battery life, and the best thing there is nothing much you can do with it. No memory card, camera, apps only FM and few games like snake. You will be pushed out of your world. It's good when you are on a trekk, you will engage with nature more. Downside for snake lovers is that the game isn't that good which it used to be on this mobile :)","09 Mar 2020","Colour: Black","","Yes","Bhuvnesh Kumar","5.0","NOKIA 105 2019 (Dual SIM, Black)","https://www.amazon.in/NOKIA-105-2019-Dual-Black/product-reviews/B07WXW8V4X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best Phone Under 8K","One of the best budget phones available under 8K.

Do not expect playing high end games. PUBG LITE runs with minor glitches during gameplay Sound - Speaker output quality isn't upto the mark while playing videos and music but manageable.

"Misleading EMI option on Amazon","The product is fine and working well. Battery and camera quality is phenomenal and met the expectations.  Unfortunately the Amazon promise on zero cost EMI is misleading. I opted for 6 months EMI considering zero percent interest.

I got red color which is nice it has free back case in my case it had some powder stains on it but i cleaned it. Trick I played for buying good camera phone. I went to mobile cafe and asked them for good camera phone in 10k. They gave me 4 options.  Using test phones in shop I clikc2d same photo and found this model better.

"WARNING !!!","What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body ... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ... I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ...

Camera 4.5/5 - the primary lens with 48mp is good.  However, what sets this phone aside is the 8mp macro lens, I was able to take close up shots with great clarity. Battery - 4.5/5 - the battery is good to last whole day with good 4G usage in games,  entertainment  and music,  the charging with VOOC is really good. Display 5/5 - the AMOLED display is awesome and the fingerprint sensor on the screen is really fast.

"Handy and stylish 🤩 very gradient","To early to give usability review. First impression after using for just some hours. Being a iPhone user for a decade I say touch response is incomparable at this price range as it’s just amazing as I dint felt any different . The amoled display it self is amazing. If you have budget of 20k just go for it.the back planner really gets you in one look. Helios p70 does compete with SD665. 8 gb ram is all u need for a lovely working n can go to heavy working. As of now I can just say it will last with me for atlea 2 to 3 yrs and will surely be writing one more review after a week or month of usage. Will be more specific. If u comparing it with other phones at this range I don’t think so any of other would last in comparison to oppo’s trust. One more thing vooc charge is just amazing and super went 50 to hundred in just 20 mins.","31 Jan 2020","Colour: Unicorn White Size name: 8GB Style name: with offer","","Yes","Ashish Mishra","5.0","OPPO F15 (Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage, with offer)","https://www.amazon.in/OPPO-Blue-128GB-Storage-offer/product-reviews/B086K9XK6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Review after visiting Oppo service center- First visit sir pls back up your data Second visit sir your mobile is exposed to liquid so it won't come under warranty so we can't help. Mobile purchase within 3 month no rain no accidentally exposed to liquid but who cares and even I don't know what they said is true or not! 3 month and 20000rs mobile in vain This might be personal frustration but you can be the next one.

"Overall nice.. If you further want to buy Chinese phone then only.","I am giving this review after 6 months of continuous use. I have given this phone to my wife as Anniversary gifts ❤.. Ok coming to the review: Pros: 1)awesome picture quality. Nice color effect and precession. 2) Video quality is also very good. HD video is Cristal clear.. 3) Face recognition is Very good. 4) Finger print reader also nice.. Average. 5) Selfie camera📷: it's awesome.. She likes the selfi camera more than anything.. 6)Sound quality is good 👍. 7) First charging is great. It takes max 20 min to fully charge the mobile. 8) No heating problem till now. 9) Came with earphones in box. 🙂. Currently no company giving earphones In box. 10) No question about storage. Cons: 1) Battery life is not like it has been given in the advertisement documentary. After full charge it works max 8 to 9 hrs if you fully utilize the phone, without gaming. 2) Charger 🔋🔌 got heatead while charging. 3) Sound : not that great, sounds quality is good but not that louder🔊.. 4) No default screen recording app is there unlike Redmi. Overall it good.. If you are game lover then I don't know because my wife don't like game so I could not installed any game in her phone😌. Once I did she took the phone and uninstall that without my knowledge 😅, all my efforts were wasted ☹️😭 Most important: This is made in China.. So for my Indian citizens,if you really want to buy made in China products then you can check my review. I bought it on February 2020☹️😞 for me 👎.","04 Jul 2020","Colour: Lightening Black Size name: 8GB Style name: with offer","","Yes","Proud to be India🇮🇳","4.0","OPPO F15 (Blue, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage, with offer)","https://www.amazon.in/OPPO-Blue-128GB-Storage-offer/product-reviews/B086K9XK6F/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"WARNING !!!","What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body ... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ... I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ...

"All rounder","Reviewing after 5 days. Design feels solid as front and back both protected by gorilla glass 6. Easy to hold. Not bulky. Weight around 185 grams. Which is well distributed. Piano black color is descent. Comes with Android 10. Display is amoled. Shifted from ips display. Finding amoled display much better. Display size is 6.44 inches. So phone is not too big. Touch response is smooth. No lags or hanging. Works very smooth Haven't played games yet Charges fast. Gets slightly warm while charging as it 33 watts fast charging but does not heat or overheat Earphones are gud. Although design feels like copied from Samsung s20 ultra. Speakers are loud amd clear. No network issue till now. Earpiece quality is gud and mic also receive the audio properly. There is call recording option and native video calling Option. Triple card slot. Much required. 6 cameras- 4 in the back and 2 in the front. Cameras are gud. Sometimes there are issues in exposure while capturing through front camera. Background is blown out. But it can be adjusted before or after clicking the image. After adjusting exposure,pics comes quite natural and detailed. Rear Camera has pro mode. Images from back camera are really gud, natural, detailed, sharp. Video recording upto 4k 30 fps. 1080p 60 fps also available. Lots of customization features. Coming to price. Too much. Considering the fact it is offline centric. 22k should have been the price with some additional offers. Back cover provided is really gud. Fits tightly.","08 Jun 2020","Colour: Piano Black Size name: 128 GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Milan jeswani","5.0","Vivo V19 (Piano Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Vivo-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B08444WMGT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"
"not worth for money","This phone is not worth for 28k, performance is very bad. After using it for 7 day's I'm writing this review. 1. I am not a gamer or don't run any app to consume high performance. I have the regular banking and social apps and default phone apps. Internal memory not consumed more then 20gb. Still this phone takes time to load home page. This is really ridiculous. 2. Some modes in this phone are not working exactly upto the mark. A. Dark mode - it will not change to dark mode by the time I select, May change when phone wishes to do. Viseversa if i would like deselect dark mode. B. When loading - screen flickering occurs often in many common applications. GDrive, Gpay, whatsapp and opera browser. C. Receivers are not seeing my face in whatsapp app video call, in duo its working fine. Only in my call receivers facing this issue. Camera I did not test much, but I didn't see any issues. Clarity is good. Finget scan is not fast compare to competitor phones. My overall rating is 1 for 5 Complaint s registered with Amazon, Technician did not visit to inspect the phone. All the above complaints works randomly, I had screen recored and shots for proof to show.","26 Jun 2020","Colour: Mystic Silver Size name: 128 GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","vignesh","1.0","Vivo V19 (Piano Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Vivo-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B08444WMGT/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Perfectly fine and fantastic mobile.","I got it on 20th June. Using for more than one month. This is absolutely fantastic product. Amazon packaging was fantastic. Delivered carefully before expected time. Before this I  was using vivo v5s for last 3.5 years , still this is in very good condition and now I purchased Vivo V19. Mobile looks Just fantastic. Both sides' cameras are perfectly fine. Picture quality given above. One thing I have to say that prosser speed is 2.3 Ghz not 2 GHz and this is satisfactory. Battery charging time 0% - 100% 1 hour 20 min. Battery life is very nice depends upon your using.","26 Jul 2020","Colour: Mystic Silver Size name: 256 GB Style name: with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","","Yes","Subhayu Mukherjee","5.0","Vivo V19 (Piano Black, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers","https://www.amazon.in/Vivo-Storage-Additional-Exchange-Offers/product-reviews/B08444WMGT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"WARNING !!!","What !!! 13k priced phone with Snapdragon 450 processor is just a Worst thing. Second thing is it's front camera ... Which is Average... Guys you should go for Samsung M30 rather than this device... Because they have sold a old phone with new outer body ... Phone performance is very low... This phone is not at all good for gaming and for photography ... A simple use of this phone ... But Battery is WATTA MONTSER !!! You will be loving battery of this device with 15W fast charging ... And no other good thing in this phone... Your mobile will hang during heavy multitasking because of very average processor Snapdragon 450 ... I recommend you should go for SAMSUNG M21 or SAMSUNG M30 or Samsung M31... They are incredible !!! Samsung phones are long lasting workable ... Phone will not get any problem for 1 to 2 years ...

Takes about 3 hours and more for charging even though with fast charging from 0 to 100 at first time but second time it charges very quick. From 20 to 91 it takes about 1 hr 40 min.

I was on call for over an hour and qued for a chat via laptop for about 45 mins (photos attached, you can see the call wait time on the phone as well).

Good all round camera(front one could have ben better) 4. Superb gaming experience, this device is a beast for gaming. 5. Has USB-PD support too, didn't know till I used a pd charger in this device. Cons: 1. Black crush issue is there when set to 120Hz refresh rate, maybe can get fixed through an OTA and its not a deal breaker for me 2. Horizontal black bar is present from front camera area when set to 120Hz, don't know if it can be fixed with an OTA update or not, again not a deal breaker for me 3. I miss the headphone jack😅. Overall i am happy with my purchase. All I wanted a super fast and responsive device.

"Stay away","This is for sure my last android phone. I have been a hardcore android user nd lover since samsung galaxy 2 days but now after using iphone xr for 4 months, I can't stick to android anymore. The smoothness,ui and apps compatibility provided by ios is unmatched even by this 120 hz monster by oneplus. Surely the screen quality is one thing,which iphones can't match with android but apart from that its worthless to spend so much on android. I am specifically giving one star to oneplus for its build quality. I dropped my phone from 6 inch height on a tile and the side frame literally chipped off from one edge. I would have tolerated a scatch or a dent but the metal piece just chipped off completely like a brittle substance. This can't be expected from a flagship.","26 Jun 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Ankush Gautam","1.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-750/product-reviews/B07DJCYBVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

From its stunning display to its brilliant cameras to its powerful processor, its beyond beautiful. I waited 2.5 months for this phone and finally got it on the 3rd sale.

The 8 Pro truly screams flagship. Owning it is like a dream come true. Its not just a smartphone, its an much more! 2020 may not be the year we expected it to be, but One Plus gave some positivity with this one phone. Loving every second of my time with this beast!

If you are using the device in a dark room, you will feel that brightness is high. 3. If you are using the device in 120 + QHD then do not expect even fair battery backup. 4.

"Impressive so far! Apprehensive about display ""issues""","After one day of use: Stellar camera, smooth UI, battery takes a beating with 120hz and Qhd+ turned on. But then again the charge out of the box gets you back up in no time. For reference, my previous phone was a Poco F1 and I use it for emails, social media, podcasts and viewing video content. I found the camera inadequate on the Poco F1 and boy this phone is certainly an upgrade in the photography department! My unit was manufactured in June. I do seem to have the ""black crush"" issue. I streamed a video on my poco and on this phone, clearly shadows are crushed, details are lost, there are gradient lines in the shadows unlike my Poco which looks cleaner with more details in the shadows. I don't know if you think of this as a deal breaker. Maybe it is (esp if it's a hardware issue). I'm going to stick with the phone as I don't think of it as a major problem. And yes, I tried turning off 120hz and Qhd+ , I've compared at different levels of brightness and no real difference: shadows, darker regions look cleaner on the Poco's  IPS panel. OS Update did not help either. Again, not a big deal and you'll probably never be bothered by it. Don't particularly care for the curved screen beyond the ""wow it's like a waterfall"" feeling you get for the first 10 minutes. It is a big phone, not so much when using it but when you want to put in your pocket.","01 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","p____t","4.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-750/product-reviews/B07DJCYBVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Its display is actually rounded on the sides, rather than just having curved glass like on the 8.

"Not exactly as per the hype","I've given 3 stars. So, let me explain why. Pros which warrant 5 stars: 1. The superfast charging, the screen quality, the smooth feel, the amazing speaker. I can add a few more. 2. Screen is particularly awesome with adaptive colour changes which is very soft on eyes. 3. Similarly speakers are really good and loud. Amazing. Cons that made it lose stars: 1. Battery: a phone with 120 hz and QHD+ display warrants a bigger battery. 4500 mah can never last a day. 2. I paid for 4 cameras, I got three. 3. It has Snapdragon 865, supposedly the fastest chip around. Yet my telegram and chrome have hanged multiple times by now (in barely one week of use). 4. I was using Redmi note 5 pro before. May be I shouldn't be comparing an in-screen fingerprint reader with a dedicated one at the back, but that was a way cheaper phone. The fingerprint reader on that worked really smooth. Here, well it works. Is it a great phone? Yes. Will I recommend buying it? Yes. But does it do justice to its reputation? No. Hence, the rating is the gap between expectation and reality.","05 Jul 2020","Style name: 8GB RAM + 128GB Storage Colour: Onyx Black","","Yes","Satyam Choudhary","3.0","OnePlus 8 Pro (Onyx Black 8GB RAM+128GB Storage)","https://www.amazon.in/Test-Exclusive-750/product-reviews/B07DJCYBVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_4?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=4&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Too many fingerprint marks. Need to clean it after everytime I use it. 2. The pre applied screen guard quality has become worse. Looks like a 100 rupee screen guard.

"Very good Basic phone from Nokia","If you are looking for Nokia brand and just feature phone and i would certainly recommend it. This basic phone will be very useful for people who wants to listen to songs and capture some images (of course it is just 0.3 MP camera). It comes from the brand Nokia which is reliable brand in basic category. Pros: Dual sim is plus point for many people who uses two SIM . Easy navigation for those who try to learn phone usage first time (Applicable to elders who are getting used to) Battery life is very long lasting as many Nokia phones. Sound is good -clear and audible. Loud speaker sound might not be enough , hold on that is decent though. Sturdy phone for long durability. Cons: Price factor is little high but that's okay for a phone to get it from Nokia. We got it for 2350 in Festive sale. Verdict: Recommended if you want only basic feature phone with MP3 player and camera. (Don't expect much from basic phone, because it is to simplify needs).","14 Nov 2018","Colour: Black","","Yes","John zach","5.0","Nokia 216 (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-216-Black/product-reviews/B01M69DXTB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Best feature phone but not elder friendly","This is a good phone, no doubt on it. I purchased it for my parents so will review only based on elder friendly if any one has doubts on it. Sound : its clear even for elders, no comments. Features : radio, audio, video, also internet for emergency , okay am satisfied. Interface : Bit dissapointment, even youngsters should do a bit exercise to check all features and to adjust according to needs, cant change 70% of default features (mostly related to buttons) Screen : Yes this may be best feature,but this is the actual dissapointment, reason is the screen ratio is larger than button pad. This makes it bit difficult for single hand usage and may be pain for elders. Games : Why should i download it from your appstore and is not installed by default ( miss 4g here as 2g internet has become more costlier :p ) may be i should change my plan. Storage : Thanks for the expandable 32gb, i can store both audio and video songs.","24 Oct 2018","","","Yes","Karthik","3.0","Nokia 216 (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-216-Black/product-reviews/B01M69DXTB/ref=cm_cr_dp_d_show_all_btm?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Fantastic mobile with front camera and front flash","After using a smartphone for a little too many days and being stuck in constant distractions, I've traded in my smartphone for this dumb phone, and I've been so happy with this decision. The OS is simple and lag free, basic functions like the camera and music player work as expected. The music player is a little too bare-bones for my liking but it's still passable at this price. Call quality is good, battery life is pretty good as well, and it recognises 4G sim cards albeit it doesn't really support 4G call quality or even the internet!

"Perfect phone","A neat, lightweight little phone with dual SIM and internet connection - although I won't use the latter. I bought it because for my grandmother and I wanted a phone with a camera.....but not a Smartphone.  1) First thing - it comes with a charging cable on the end of which is a 2-pin continental type plug. 2) It's fairly straightforward to set up which is just as well as the instruction sheet lacks any instructions in English! I have found the manual on the Nokia website, so that's okay. I have one or two quibbles with this phone not least of which is the main control button - that big(gish) square one in the middle.  By default the menu choice always seems to be on Messaging, and moving it, using said button, is, at times, tricky. Oh - and if you want to listen to music on this phone don't think you can use just any old headphones - nope, you need to get them from Nokia, which, personally, I think is outrageous and greedy. I'm quite happy with this phone, certainly the dual SIM wil l be useful when I go travelling again - saves having to change SIMs or buy a phone in a foreign country - that was another reason for buying this phone.","06 Jan 2019","Colour: Black","","Yes","Goku_Modoriya","5.0","Nokia 216 (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-216-Black/product-reviews/B01M69DXTB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_2?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=2&reviewerType=all_reviews"

Some other brands has similar phone in the market with little lesser price with nearly same features. But most of them has a problem of non availability of replacement battery. So I opted for this one. I installed 32GB card for extra storage & it is functioning well without any lagging. Sound quality is OK with earphones but it starts to crack when played in speaker mode. It has 2 VERY BASIC cameras (front & rear) with flash on both sides.

"Not so worthy Nokia phone","I purchased this phone only for the Nokia branding which used to stand as a standard of quality and durability. However, this is in no way better compared to other phones available in market. Please note that it is 2G only phone. You will not be able to run your Jio sim on this. You will also not be able to consume 3G services on this phone. The body is plastic and this time Nokia has used cheap quality plastic as used by other manufacturers. The right shortcut button takes selfie and cannot be configured to do anything else which is a kind of stupid thing on a phone with very very poor camera. Overall, the purpose of using a feature phone with keypad is served but the price tag is very high and you pay it for Nokia brand. However the overall build quality is not what it used to be of Nokia phones. Same priced Samsung phones offers quite a lot features, better build quality and better OS.","30 Apr 2019","","","Yes","Murtuza Kabul","2.0","Nokia 216 (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-216-Black/product-reviews/B01M69DXTB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

"Barely ok. Massive downgrades from older nokia phones","Been using this phone since 2016. Looks and feels like a old school nokia at first. But they have downgraded certain features which were very important to me. Firstly, java games like doom rpg which used to run fine in phones from 2006-7 are stuttering in this phone from 2016. They seemed to have skimped out on ram for some reason. Secondly, the music player in this one is the most stripped doen version in any phone it is a significant downgrade since the old nokia phones. It is such a massive disappointment that it is amazing. The music player has no equalizer the shuffle feature shuffles both on the next and previous buttons whereas older nokias would randomize on the next button and play the last song on the previous one. Lastly and the biggest problem is no search feature in the music player. Who ever designed this player needs to be fired seriously. It supports 32 gb memory cards but does not have a search feature on the music player.makes no sense. It is a pain to find anything in the player. What makes this even more nonsensical is the fact that nokia phones from a decade ago did all these things that i just described. If i knew about these problems which i described beforehand i would have never bought this. Other than these problems (huge in my opinion) the phone is fine.","28 Jun 2020","Colour: Black","","Yes","suyash","3.0","Nokia 216 (Black)","https://www.amazon.in/Nokia-216-Black/product-reviews/B01M69DXTB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_paging_btm_3?ie=UTF8&pageNumber=3&reviewerType=all_reviews"

That's perhaps Nokia's definition of fast charging. Just that it switches off withing 5 mins again. Pathetic phone. Some sort of electronic junk. And since it is bought mostly for elders and new cell phone users, they struggle with its inconsistencies. Add to that pathetic service by Amazon for this product.
