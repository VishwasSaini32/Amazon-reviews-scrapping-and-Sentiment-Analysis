## Objective – 
### Scrape the customer reviews for 10 mobile phones listed on Amazon and perform Sentiment Analysis for the customer reviews.

## Procedure –

2. Develop a Sentiment Analysis model using the data provided as training data
3. Using the model you developed evaluate the sentiment of the customer reviews scraped by you.

## Project Deliverables –
1. Send us a copy of the code used to scrape the customer reviews. Your case study will be evaluated on how fast your program scrapes the reviews
2. Send us the code of your Sentiment Analysis model along with EDA.
3. Submit an excel sheet with the names of all the mobile phones along with the Fine-grained
sentiment analysis score of the customer reviews for all the mobile phones
4. Submit data visualizations to represent your sentiment analysis results.
5. Please make sure your code is well commented.
